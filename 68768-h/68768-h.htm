  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">As</span> the following pages have been hastily compiled, at the urgent
    request of a number of my friends, from a series of Letters and Notes
    written by myself during several years’ residence and travel amongst
    a number of the wildest and most remote tribes of the North American
    Indians, I have thought it best to make this page the beginning of my
    book; dispensing with Preface, and even with Dedication, other than
    that which I hereby make of it, with all my heart, to those who will
    take the pains to read it.</p>

  <p>If it be necessary to render any apology for beginning thus
    unceremoniously my readers will understand that I had no space in
    these, my first volumes, to throw away; nor much time at my disposal,
    which I could, in justice, use for introducing myself and my works to
    the world.</p>

  <p>Having commenced thus abruptly then, I will venture to take upon myself
    the sin of calling this one of the series of Letters of which I have
    spoken; although I am writing it several years later, and placing it
    at the beginning of my book; by which means I will be enabled briefly
    to introduce myself to my readers (who, as yet, know little or nothing
    of me), and also the subjects of the following epistles, with such
    explanations of the customs described in them, as will serve for a
    key or glossary to the same, and prepare the reader’s mind for the
    information they contain.</p>

  <p>Amidst the multiplicity of books which are, in this enlightened age,
    flooding the world, I feel it my duty, as early as possible, to beg
    pardon for making a book at all; and in the next (if my readers should
    become so much interested in my narrations, as to censure me for the
    brevity of the work) to take some considerable credit for not having
    trespassed too long upon their time and patience.</p>

  <p>Leaving my readers, therefore, to find out what is in the book, without
    promising them anything, I proceed to say—of <em>myself</em>, that I was
    born in Wyöming, in North America, some thirty or forty years since,
    of parents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span> who entered that beautiful and famed valley soon after the
    close of the revolutionary war, and the disastrous event of the “Indian
    massacre.”</p>

  <p>The early part of my life was whiled away, apparently, somewhat
    in vain, with books reluctantly held in one hand, and a rifle or
    fishing-pole firmly and affectionately grasped in the other.</p>

  <p>At the urgent request of my father, who was a practising lawyer, I
    was prevailed upon to abandon these favourite themes, and also my
    occasional dabblings with the brush, which had secured already a corner
    in my affections; and I commenced reading the law for a profession,
    under the direction of Reeve and Gould, of Connecticut. I attended
    the lectures of these learned judges for two years—was admitted
    to the bar—and practised the law, as a sort of <em>Nimrodical</em>
    lawyer, in my native land, for the term of two or three years; when
    I very deliberately sold my law library and all (save my rifle and
    fishing-tackle), and converting their proceeds into brushes and paint
    pots; I commenced the art of painting in Philadelphia, without teacher
    or adviser.</p>

  <p>I there closely applied my hand to the labours of the art for several
    years; during which time my mind was continually reaching for some
    branch or enterprise of the art, on which to devote a whole life-time
    of enthusiasm; when a delegation of some ten or fifteen noble and
    dignified-looking Indians, from the wilds of the “Far West,” suddenly
    arrived in the city, arrayed and equipped in all their classic
    beauty,—with shield and helmet,—with tunic and manteau,—tinted and
    tasselled off, exactly for the painter’s palette!</p>

  <p>In silent and stoic dignity, these lords of the forest strutted about
    the city for a few days, wrapped in their pictured robes, with their
    brows plumed with the quills of the war-eagle, attracting the gaze
    and admiration of all who beheld them. After this, they took their
    leave for Washington City, and I was left to reflect and regret, which
    I did long and deeply, until I came to the following deductions and
    conclusions.</p>

  <p>Black and blue cloth and civilization are destined, not only to
    veil, but to obliterate the grace and beauty of Nature. Man, in the
    simplicity and loftiness of his nature, unrestrained and unfettered
    by the disguises of art, is surely the most beautiful model for the
    painter,—and the country from which he hails is unquestionably the best
    study or school of the arts in the world: such I am sure, from the
    models I have seen, is the wilderness of North America. And the history
    and customs of such a people, preserved by pictorial illustrations,
    are themes worthy the life-time of one man, and nothing short of the
    loss of my life, shall prevent me from visiting their country, and of
    becoming their historian.</p>

  <p>There was something inexpressibly delightful in the above resolve,
    which was to bring me amidst such living models for my brush: and at
    the same time to place in my hands again, for my living and protection,
    the objects of my heart above-named; which had long been laid by to
    rust and decay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span> in the city, without the remotest prospect of again
    contributing to my amusement.</p>

  <p>I had fully resolved—I opened my views to my friends and relations,
    but got not one advocate or abettor. I tried fairly and faithfully,
    but it was in vain to reason with those whose anxieties were ready to
    fabricate every difficulty and danger that could be imagined, without
    being able to understand or appreciate the extent or importance of
    my designs, and I broke from them all,—from my wife and my aged
    parents,—myself my only adviser and protector.</p>

  <p>With these views firmly fixed—armed, equipped, and supplied, I started
    out in the year 1832, and penetrated the vast and pathless wilds
    which are familiarly denominated the great “Far West” of the North
    American Continent, with a light heart, inspired with an enthusiastic
    hope and reliance that I could meet and overcome all the hazards
    and privations of a life devoted to the production of a literal and
    graphic delineation of the living manners, customs, and character of an
    interesting race of people, who are rapidly passing away from the face
    of the earth—lending a hand to a dying nation, who have no historians
    or biographers of their own to pourtray with fidelity their native
    looks and history; thus snatching from a hasty oblivion what could be
    saved for the benefit of posterity, and perpetuating it, as a fair and
    just monument, to the memory of a truly lofty and noble race.</p>

  <p>I have spent about eight years already in the pursuit above-named,
    having been for the most of that time immersed in the Indian country,
    mingling with red men, and identifying myself with them as much as
    possible, in their games and amusements; in order the better to
    familiarize myself with their superstitions and mysteries, which are
    the keys to Indian life and character.</p>

  <p>It was during the several years of my life just mentioned, and whilst I
    was in familiar participation with them in their sports and amusements,
    that I penned the following series of epistles; describing only such
    glowing or curious scenes and events as passed under my immediate
    observation; leaving their early history, and many of their traditions,
    language, &amp;c. for a subsequent and much more elaborate work, for which
    I have procured the materials, and which I may eventually publish.</p>

  <p>I set out on my arduous and perilous undertaking with the determination
    of reaching, ultimately, every tribe of Indians on the Continent
    of North America, and of bringing home faithful portraits of their
    principal personages, both men and women, from each tribe; views of
    their villages, games, &amp;c. and full notes on their character and
    history. I designed, also, to procure their costumes, and a complete
    collection of their manufactures and weapons, and to perpetuate them in
    a <i>Gallery unique</i>, for the use and instruction of future ages.</p>

  <p>I claim whatever merit there may have been in the originality of such
    a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> design, as I was undoubtedly the first artist who ever set out upon
    such a work, designing to carry his canvass to the Rocky Mountains;
    and a considerable part of the following Letters were written and
    published in the New York Papers, as early as the years 1832 and 1833;
    long before the Tours of Washington Irving, and several others, whose
    interesting narratives are before the world.</p>

  <p>I have, as yet, by no means visited <em>all</em> the tribes; but I have
    progressed a very great way with the enterprise, and with far greater
    and more complete success than I expected.</p>

  <p>I have visited forty-eight different tribes, the greater part of which
    I found speaking different languages, and containing in all 400,000
    souls. I have brought home safe, and in good order, 310 portraits in
    oil, all painted in their native dress, and in their own wigwams;
    and also 200 other paintings in oil, containing views of their
    villages—their wigwams—their games and religious ceremonies—their
    dances—their ball plays—their buffalo hunting, and other amusements
    (containing in all, over 3000 full-length figures); and the landscapes
    of the country they live in, as well as a very extensive and curious
    collection of their costumes, and all their other manufactures, from
    the size of a wigwam down to the size of a quill or a rattle.</p>

  <p>A considerable part of the above-named paintings, and Indian
    manufactures, will be found amongst the very numerous illustrations
    in the following pages; having been, in every instance, faithfully
    copied and reduced by my own hand, for the engraver, from my original
    paintings; and the reader of this book who will take the pains to step
    in to “<span class="smcap">Catlin’s North American Indian Gallery</span>,” will find
    nearly every scene and custom which is described in this work, as well
    as many others, carefully and correctly delineated, and displayed upon
    the walls, and every weapon (and every “Sachem” and every “Sagamore”
    who has wielded them) according to the tenor of the tales herein
    recited.</p>

  <p>So much of <em>myself</em> and of my <em>works</em>, which is all that I
    wish to say at present.</p>

  <p>Of the <span class="smcap">Indians</span>, I have much more to say, and to the following
    delineations of them, and their character and customs, I shall make no
    further apology for requesting the attention of my readers.</p>

  <p>The Indians (as I shall call them), the savages or red men of the
    forests and prairies of North America, are at this time a subject of
    great interest and some importance to the civilized world; rendered
    more particularly so in this age, from their relative position to, and
    their rapid declension from, the civilized nations of the earth. A
    numerous nation of human beings, whose origin is beyond the reach of
    human investigation,—whose early history is lost—whose term of national
    existence is nearly expired—three-fourths of whose country has fallen
    into the possession of civilized man within the short space of 250
    years—twelve millions of whose bodies have fattened the soil in the
    mean time; who have fallen victims to whiskey, the small-pox, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
    bayonet; leaving at this time but a meagre proportion to live a short
    time longer, in the certain apprehension of soon sharing a similar fate.</p>

  <p>The writer who would undertake to embody the whole history of such a
    people, with all their misfortunes and calamities, must needs have much
    more space than I have allotted to this epitome; and he must needs
    begin also (as I am doing) with those who are <em>living</em>, or he
    would be very apt to dwell upon the preamble of his work, until the
    present living remnants of the race should have passed away; and their
    existence and customs, like those of ages gone bye, become subjects of
    doubt and incredulity to the world for whom his book was preparing.
    Such an historian also, to do them justice, must needs correct many
    theories and opinions which have, either ignorantly or maliciously,
    gone forth to the world in indelible characters; and gather and arrange
    a vast deal which has been but imperfectly recorded, or placed to
    the credit of a people who have not had the means of recording it
    themselves; but have entrusted it, from necessity, to the honesty and
    punctuality of their enemies.</p>

  <p>In such an history should be embodied, also, a correct account of their
    treatment, and the causes which have led to their rapid destruction;
    and a plain and systematical prophecy as to the time and manner of
    their final extinction, based upon the causes and the ratio of their
    former and present declension.</p>

  <p>So Herculean a task may fall to my lot at a future period, or it
    may not: but I send forth these volumes at this time, fresh and
    full of their living deeds and customs, as a familiar and unstudied
    introduction (at least) to them and their native character; which I
    confidently hope will repay the readers who read for information and
    historical facts, as well as those who read but for amusement.</p>

  <p>The world know generally, that the Indians of North America are
    copper-coloured; that their eyes and their hair are black, &amp;c.; that
    they are mostly uncivilized, and consequently unchristianized; that
    they are nevertheless human beings, with features, thoughts, reason,
    and sympathies like our own; but few yet know how they <em>live</em>, how
    they <em>dress</em>, how they <em>worship</em>, what are their actions,
    their customs, their religion, their amusements, &amp;c. as they practise
    them in the uncivilized regions of their uninvaded country, which it is
    the main object of this work, clearly and distinctly to set forth.</p>

  <p>It would be impossible at the same time, in a book of these dimensions,
    to explain <em>all</em> the manners and customs of these people; but as
    far as they are narrated, they have been described by my pen, upon the
    spot, as I have seen them transacted; and if some few of my narrations
    should seem a <em>little too highly coloured</em>, I trust the world
    will be ready to extend to me that pardon which it is customary to
    yield to all artists whose main faults exist in the vividness of their
    colouring, rather than in the drawing of their pictures; but there
    is nothing else in them, I think, that I should ask pardon for, even
    though some of them should stagger credulity, and incur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> for me the
    censure of those critics, who sometimes, unthinkingly or unmercifully,
    sit at home at their desks, enjoying the luxury of wine and a good
    cigar, over the simple narration of the honest and weather-worn
    traveller (who shortens his half-starved life in catering for the
    world), to condemn him and his work to oblivion, and his wife and his
    little children to poverty and starvation; merely because he describes
    scenes which they have not beheld, and which, consequently, they are
    unable to believe.</p>

  <p>The Indians of North America, as I have before said, are
    copper-coloured, with long black hair, black eyes, tall, straight, and
    elastic forms—are less than two millions in number—were originally
    the undisputed owners of the soil, and got their title to their lands
    from the Great Spirit who created them on it,—were once a happy and
    flourishing people, enjoying all the comforts and luxuries of life
    which they knew of, and consequently cared for:—were sixteen millions
    in numbers, and sent that number of daily prayers to the Almighty,
    and thanks for his goodness and protection. Their country was entered
    by white men, but a few hundred years since; and thirty millions of
    these are now scuffling for the goods and luxuries of life, over
    the bones and ashes of twelve millions of red men; six millions of
    whom have fallen victims to the small-pox, and the remainder to the
    sword, the bayonet, and whiskey; all of which means of their death and
    destruction have been introduced and visited upon them by acquisitive
    white men; and by white men, also, whose forefathers were welcomed
    and embraced in the land where the poor Indian met and fed them with
    “ears of green corn and with pemican.” Of the two millions remaining
    alive at this time, about 1,400,000, are already the miserable living
    victims and dupes of white man’s cupidity, degraded, discouraged and
    lost in the bewildering maze that is produced by the use of whiskey and
    its concomitant vices; and the remaining number are yet unroused and
    unenticed from their wild haunts or their primitive modes, by the dread
    or love of white man and his allurements.</p>

  <p>It has been with these, mostly, that I have spent my time, and of
    these, chiefly, and their customs, that the following Letters treat.
    Their habits (and their’s alone) as we can see them transacted, are
    native, and such as I have wished to fix and preserve for future ages.</p>

  <p>Of the dead, and of those who are dying, of those who have suffered
    death, and of those who are now trodden and kicked through it, I may
    speak more fully in some deductions at the close of this book; or at
    some future time, when I may find more leisure, and may be able to
    speak of these scenes without giving offence to the world, or to any
    body in it.</p>

  <p>Such a portrait then as I have set forth in the following pages (taken
    by myself from the free and vivid realities of life, instead of the
    vague and uncertain imagery of recollection, or from the haggard
    deformities and distortions of disease and death), I offer to the world
    for their amusement, as well as for their information; and I trust they
    will pardon me, if it should be thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span> that I have over-estimated the
    Indian character, or at other times descended too much into the details
    and minutiæ of Indian mysteries and absurdities.</p>

  <p>The reader, then, to understand me rightly, and draw from these Letters
    the information which they are intended to give, must follow me a vast
    way from the civilized world; he must needs wend his way from the city
    of New York, over the Alleghany, and far beyond the mighty Missouri,
    and even to the base and summit of the Rocky Mountains, some two or
    three thousand miles from the Atlantic coast. He should forget many
    theories he has read in the books of Indian barbarities, of wanton
    butcheries and murders; and divest himself, as far as possible of the
    deadly prejudices which he has carried from his childhood, against this
    most unfortunate and most abused part of the race of his fellow-man.</p>

  <p>He should consider, that if he has seen the savages of North America
    without making such a tour, he has fixed his eyes upon and drawn his
    conclusions (in all probability) only from those who inhabit the
    frontier; whose habits have been changed—whose pride has been cut
    down—whose country has been ransacked—whose wives and daughters have
    been shamefully abused—whose lands have been wrested from them—whose
    limbs have become enervated and naked by the excessive use of
    whiskey—whose friends and relations have been prematurely thrown into
    their graves—whose native pride and dignity have at last given way to
    the unnatural vices which civilized cupidity has engrafted upon them,
    to be silently nurtured and magnified by a burning sense of injury and
    injustice, and ready for that cruel vengeance which often falls from
    the hand that is palsied by refined abuses, and yet unrestrained by the
    glorious influences of refined and moral cultivation.—That if he has
    laid up what he considers well-founded knowledge of these people, from
    books which he has read, and from newspapers only, he should pause at
    least, and withhold his sentence before he passes it upon the character
    of a people, who are dying at the hands of their enemies, without the
    means of recording their own annals—struggling in their nakedness with
    their simple weapons, against guns and gunpowder—against whiskey and
    steel, and disease, and mailed warriors who are continually trampling
    them to the earth, and at last exultingly promulgating from the very
    soil which they have wrested from the poor savage, the history of his
    cruelties and barbarities, whilst his bones are quietly resting under
    the very furrows which their ploughs are turning.</p>

  <p>So great and unfortunate are the disparities between savage and civil,
    in numbers—in weapons and defences—in enterprise, in craft, and in
    education, that the former is almost universally the sufferer either in
    peace or in war; and not less so after his pipe and his tomahawk have
    retired to the grave with him, and his character is left to be entered
    upon the pages of history, and that justice done to his memory which
    from necessity, he has intrusted to his enemy.</p>

  <p>Amongst the numerous historians, however, of these strange people, they
    have had some friends who have done them justice; yet as a part of all
    systems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span> of justice whenever it is meted to the poor Indian, it comes
    invariably too late, or is administered at an ineffectual distance; and
    that too when his enemies are continually about him, and effectually
    applying the means of his destruction.</p>

  <p>Some writers, I have been grieved to see, have written down the
    character of the North American Indian, as dark, relentless, cruel and
    murderous in the last degree; with scarce a quality to stamp their
    existence of a higher order than that of the brutes:—whilst others
    have given them a high rank, as I feel myself authorized to do, as
    honourable and highly-intellectual beings; and others, both friends and
    foes to the red men, have spoken of them as an “anomaly in nature!”</p>

  <p>In this place I have no time or inclination to reply to so
    unaccountable an assertion as this; contenting myself with the belief,
    that the term would be far more correctly applied to that part of the
    human family who have strayed farthest from nature, than it could be to
    those who are simply moving in, and filling the sphere for which they
    were designed by the Great Spirit who made them.</p>

  <p>From what I have seen of these people I feel authorized to say, that
    there is nothing very strange or unaccountable in their character; but
    that it is a simple one, and easy to be learned and understood, if the
    right means be taken to familiarize ourselves with it. Although it has
    its dark spots, yet there is much in it to be applauded, and much to
    recommend it to the admiration of the enlightened world. And I trust
    that the reader, who looks through these volumes with care, will be
    disposed to join me in the conclusion that the North American Indian in
    his native state, is an honest, hospitable, faithful, brave, warlike,
    cruel, revengeful, relentless,—yet honourable, contemplative and
    religious being.</p>

  <p>If such be the case, I am sure there is enough in it to recommend it
    to the fair perusal of the world, and charity enough in all civilized
    countries, in this enlightened age, to extend a helping hand to a
    dying race; provided that prejudice and fear can be removed, which
    have heretofore constantly held the civilized portions in dread of the
    savage—and away from that familiar and friendly embrace, in which alone
    his true native character can be justly appreciated.</p>

  <p>I am fully convinced, from a long familiarity with these people, that
    the Indian’s misfortune has consisted chiefly in our ignorance of their
    true native character and disposition, which has always held us at a
    distrustful distance from them; inducing us to look upon them in no
    other light than that of a hostile foe, and worthy only of that system
    of continued warfare and abuse that has been for ever waged against
    them.</p>

  <p>There is no difficulty in approaching the Indian and getting acquainted
    with him in his wild and unsophisticated state, and finding him an
    honest and honourable man; with feelings to meet feelings, if the above
    prejudice and dread can be laid aside, and any one will take the pains,
    as I have done, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> go and see him in the simplicity of his native
    state, smoking his pipe under his own humble roof, with his wife and
    children around him, and his faithful dogs and horses hanging about
    his hospitable tenement.—So the world <em>may</em> see him and smoke
    his friendly pipe, which will be invariably extended to them; and
    share, with a hearty welcome, the best that his wigwam affords for the
    appetite, which is always set out to a stranger the next moment after
    he enters.</p>

  <p>But so the mass of the world, most assuredly, will <em>not</em> see these
    people; for they are too far off, and approachable to those only whose
    avarice or cupidity alone lead them to those remote regions, and whose
    shame prevents them from publishing to the world the virtues which they
    have thrown down and trampled under foot.</p>

  <p>The very use of the word savage, as it is applied in its general sense,
    I am inclined to believe is an abuse of the word, and the people to
    whom it is applied. The word, in its true definition, means no more
    than <em>wild</em>, or <em>wild man</em>; and a wild man may have been
    endowed by his Maker with all the humane and noble traits that inhabit
    the heart of a tame man. Our ignorance and dread or fear of these
    people, therefore, have given a new definition to the adjective; and
    nearly the whole civilized world apply the word <em>savage</em>, as
    expressive of the most ferocious, cruel, and murderous character that
    can be described.</p>

  <p>The grizzly bear is called savage, because he is blood-thirsty,
    ravenous and cruel; and so is the tiger, and they, like the poor red
    man, have been feared and dreaded (from the distance at which ignorance
    and prejudice have kept us from them, or from resented abuses which we
    have practised when we have come in close contact with them), until Van
    Amburgh shewed the world, that even these ferocious and unreasoning
    animals wanted only the friendship and close embrace of their master,
    to respect and to love him.</p>

  <p>As evidence of the hospitality of these ignorant and benighted people,
    and also of their honesty and honour, there will be found recorded
    many striking instances in the following pages. And also, as an offset
    to these, many evidences of the dark and cruel, as well as ignorant
    and disgusting excesses of passions, unrestrained by the salutary
    influences of laws and Christianity.</p>

  <p>I have roamed about from time to time during seven or eight years,
    visiting and associating with some three or four hundred thousand of
    these people, under an almost infinite variety of circumstances; and
    from the very many and decided voluntary acts of their hospitality
    and kindness, I feel bound to pronounce them, by nature, a kind and
    hospitable people. I have been welcomed generally in their country,
    and treated to the best that they could give me, without any charges
    made for my board; they have often escorted me through their enemies’
    country at some hazard to their own lives, and aided me in passing
    mountains and rivers with my awkward baggage;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> and under all of these
    circumstances of exposure, no Indian ever betrayed me, struck me a
    blow, or stole from me a shilling’s worth of my property that I am
    aware of.</p>

  <p>This is saying a great deal, (and proving it too, if the reader will
    believe me) in favour of the virtues of these people; when it is borne
    in mind, as it should be, that there is no law in their land to punish
    a man for theft—that locks and keys are not known in their country—that
    the commandments have never been divulged amongst them; nor can any
    human retribution fall upon the head of a thief, save the disgrace
    which attaches as a stigma to his character, in the eyes of his people
    about him.</p>

  <p>And thus in these little communities, strange as it may seem, in the
    absence of all systems of jurisprudence, I have often beheld peace
    and happiness, and quiet, reigning supreme, for which even kings and
    emperors might envy them. I have seen rights and virtue protected,
    and wrongs redressed; and I have seen conjugal, filial and paternal
    affection in the simplicity and contentedness of nature. I have
    unavoidably, formed warm and enduring attachments to some of these
    men which I do not wish to forget—who have brought me near to their
    hearts, and in our final separation have embraced me in their arms, and
    commended me and my affairs to the keeping of the Great Spirit.</p>

  <p>For the above reasons, the reader will be disposed to forgive me for
    dwelling so long and so strong on the justness of the claims of these
    people; and for my occasional expressions of sadness, when my heart
    bleeds for the fate that awaits the remainder of their unlucky race;
    which is long to be outlived by the rocks, by the beasts, and even
    birds and reptiles of the country they live in;—set upon by their
    fellow-man, whose cupidity, it is feared, will fix no bounds to the
    Indian’s earthly calamity, short of the grave.</p>

  <p>I cannot help but repeat, before I close this Letter, that the tribes
    of the red men of North America, as a nation of human beings, are on
    their wane; that (to use their own very beautiful figure) “they are
    fast travelling to the shades of their fathers, towards the setting
    sun;” and that the traveller who would see these people in their native
    simplicity and beauty, must needs be hastily on his way to the prairies
    and Rocky Mountains, or he will see them only as they are now seen
    on the frontiers, as a basket of <em>dead game</em>,—harassed, chased,
    bleeding and dead; with their plumage and colours despoiled; to be
    gazed amongst in vain for some system or moral, or for some scale by
    which to estimate their true native character, other than that which
    has too often recorded them but a dark and unintelligible mass of
    cruelty and barbarity.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

  <p>Without further comments I close this Letter, introducing my readers
    at once to the heart of the Indian country, only asking their
    forgiveness for having made it so long, and their patience whilst
    travelling through the following pages (as I journeyed through those
    remote realms) in search of information and rational amusement; in
    tracing out the true character of that “<em>strange anomaly</em>” of man
    in the simple elements of his nature, undissolved or compounded into
    the mysteries of enlightened and fashionable life.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MOUTH OF YELLOW STONE, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>, 1832.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">I arrived</span> at this place yesterday in the steamer “Yellow Stone,”
    after a voyage of nearly three months from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, a distance of
    two thousand miles, the greater part of which has never before been
    navigated by steam; and the almost insurmountable difficulties which
    continually oppose the <i lang="fr">voyageur</i> on this turbid stream, have
    been by degrees overcome by the indefatigable zeal of Mr. Chouteau, a
    gentleman of great perseverance, and part proprietor of the boat. To
    the politeness of this gentleman I am indebted for my passage from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Louis to this place, and I had also the pleasure of his <em>company</em>,
    with that of Major Sanford, the government agent for the Missouri
    Indians.</p>

  <p>The American Fur Company have erected here, for their protection
    against the savages, a very substantial Fort, 300 feet square, with
    bastions armed with ordnance (<a href="#i_003"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 3</a>); and our approach
    to it under the continued roar of cannon for half an hour, and the
    shrill yells of the half-affrighted savages who lined the shores,
    presented a scene of the most thrilling and picturesque appearance. A
    voyage so full of incident, and furnishing so many novel scenes of the
    picturesque and romantic, as we have passed the numerous villages of
    the “astonished natives,” saluting them with the puffing of steam and
    the thunder of artillery, would afford subject for many epistles; and I
    cannot deny myself the pleasure of occasionally giving you some little
    sketches of scenes that I have witnessed, and <em>am witnessing</em>; and
    of the singular feelings that are excited in the breast of the stranger
    travelling through this interesting country. Interesting (as I have
    said) and <em>luxurious</em>, for this is truly the land of Epicures; we
    are invited by the savages to feasts of <em>dog’s meat</em>, as the most
    honourable food that can be presented to a stranger, and glutted with
    the more delicious food of beavers’ tails, and buffaloes’ tongues. You
    will, no doubt, be somewhat surprised on the receipt of a Letter from
    me, so far strayed into the Western World; and still more startled,
    when I tell you that I am here in the full enthusiasm and practice of
    my art. That enthusiasm alone has brought me into this remote region,
    3500 miles from my native soil; the last 2000 of which have furnished
    me with almost unlimited models, both in landscape and the human
    figure, exactly suited to my feelings. I am now in the full possession
    and enjoyments of those conditions, on which alone I was induced to
    pursue the art as a profession; and in anticipation of which alone, my
    admiration for the art could ever have been kindled into a pure flame.
    I mean the free use of nature’s undisguised models, with the privilege
    of selecting for myself. If I am here losing the benefit of the
    fleeting fashions of the day, and neglecting that elegant polish, which
    the world say an artist should draw from a continual intercourse with
    the polite world; yet have I this consolation, that in this country,
    I am entirely divested of those dangerous steps and allurements which
    beset an artist in fashionable life; and have little to steal my
    thoughts away from the contemplation of the beautiful models that
    are about me. If, also, I have not here the benefit of that feeling
    of emulation, which is the life and spur to the arts, where artists
    are associates together; yet am I surrounded by living models of such
    elegance and beauty, that I feel an unceasing excitement of a much
    higher order—the certainty that I am drawing knowledge from the true
    source. My enthusiastic admiration of man in the honest and elegant
    simplicity of nature, has always fed the warmest feelings of my bosom,
    and shut half the avenues to my heart against the specious refinements
    of the accomplished world. This feeling, together with the desire to
    study my art, independently of the embarrassments which the ridiculous
    fashions of civilized society have thrown in its way, has led me to the
    wilderness for a while, as the true school of the arts.</p>

  <p>I have for a long time been of opinion, that the wilderness of our
    country afforded models equal to those from which the Grecian sculptors
    transferred to the marble such inimitable grace and beauty; and I am
    now more confirmed in this opinion, since I have immersed myself in
    the midst of thousands and tens of thousands of these knights of the
    forest; whose whole lives are lives of chivalry, and whose daily feats,
    with their naked limbs, might vie with those of the Grecian youths in
    the beautiful rivalry of the Olympian games.</p>

  <p>No man’s imagination, with all the aids of description that can be
    given to it, can ever picture the beauty and wildness of scenes that
    may be daily witnessed in this romantic country; of hundreds of these
    graceful youths, without a care to wrinkle, or a fear to disturb
    the full expression of pleasure and enjoyment that beams upon their
    faces—their long black hair mingling with their horses’ tails, floating
    in the wind, while they are flying over the carpeted prairie, and
    dealing death with their spears and arrows, to a band of infuriated
    buffaloes; or their splendid procession in a war-parade, arrayed in all
    their gorgeous colours and trappings, moving with most exquisite grace
    and manly beauty, added to that bold defiance which man carries on his
    front, who acknowledges no superior on earth, and who is amenable to no
    laws except the laws of God and honour.</p>

  <p>In addition to the knowledge of human nature and of my art, which I
    hope to acquire by this toilsome and expensive undertaking, I have
    another in view, which, if it should not be of equal service to me,
    will be of no less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> interest and value to posterity. I have, for many
    years past, contemplated the noble races of red men who are now spread
    over these trackless forests and boundless prairies, melting away
    at the approach of civilization. Their rights invaded, their morals
    corrupted, their lands wrested from them, their customs changed, and
    therefore lost to the world; and they at last sunk into the earth, and
    the ploughshare turning the sod over their graves, and I have flown
    to their rescue—not of their lives or of their race (for they are
    “<em>doomed</em>” and must perish), but to the rescue of their looks and
    their modes, at which the acquisitive world may hurl their poison and
    every besom of destruction, and trample them down and crush them to
    death; yet, phœnix-like, they may rise from the “stain on a painter’s
    palette,” and live again upon canvass, and stand forth for centuries
    yet to come, the living monuments of a noble race. For this purpose,
    I have designed to visit every tribe of Indians on the Continent, if
    my life should be spared; for the purpose of procuring portraits of
    distinguished Indians, of both sexes in each tribe, painted in their
    native costume; accompanied with pictures of their villages, domestic
    habits, games, mysteries, religious ceremonies, &amp;c. with anecdotes,
    traditions, and history of their respective nations.</p>

  <p>If I should live to accomplish my design, the result of my labours will
    doubtless be interesting to future ages; who will have little else left
    from which to judge of the original inhabitants of this simple race of
    beings, who require but a few years more of the march of civilization
    and death, to deprive them of all their native customs and character.
    I have been kindly supplied by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and
    the Secretary of War, with letters to the commander of every military
    post, and every Indian agent on the Western Frontier, with instructions
    to render me all the facilities in their power, which will be of great
    service to me in so arduous an undertaking. The opportunity afforded me
    by familiarity with so many tribes of human beings in the simplicity of
    nature, devoid of the deformities of art; of drawing fair conclusions
    in the interesting sciences of physiognomy and phrenology; of manners
    and customs, rites, ceremonies, &amp;c.; and the opportunity of examining
    the geology and mineralogy of this western, and yet unexplored
    country, will enable me occasionally to entertain you with much new
    and interesting information, which I shall take equal pleasure in
    communicating by an occasional Letter in my clumsy way.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="subheadc">MOUTH OF YELLOW STONE, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the date of my former Letter, I have been so much engaged in
    the amusements of the country, and the use of my brush, that I have
    scarcely been able to drop you a line until the present moment.</p>

  <p>Before I let you into the amusements and customs of this delightful
    country however, (and which, as yet, are secrets to most of the world),
    I must hastily travel with you over the tedious journey of 2000 miles,
    from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis to this place; over which distance one is obliged to
    pass, before he can reach this wild and lovely spot.</p>

  <p>The Missouri is, perhaps, different in appearance and character
    from all other rivers in the world; there is a terror in its manner
    which is sensibly felt, the moment we enter its muddy waters from
    the Mississippi. From the mouth of the Yellow Stone River, which is
    the place from whence I am now writing, to its junction with the
    Mississippi, a distance of 2000 miles, the Missouri, with its boiling,
    turbid waters, sweeps off, in one unceasing current; and in the whole
    distance there is scarcely an eddy or resting-place for a canoe. Owing
    to the continual falling in of its rich alluvial banks, its water is
    always turbid and opaque; having, at all seasons of the year, the
    colour of a cup of chocolate or coffee, with sugar and cream stirred
    into it. To give a better definition of its density and opacity, I
    have tried a number of simple experiments with it at this place, and
    at other points below, at the results of which I was exceedingly
    surprised. By placing a piece of silver (and afterwards a piece of
    shell, which is a much whiter substance) in a tumbler of its water,
    and looking through the side of the glass, I ascertained that those
    substances could not be seen through the eighth part of an inch; this,
    however, is in the spring of the year, when the freshet is upon the
    river, rendering the water, undoubtedly, much more turbid than it would
    be at other seasons; though it is always muddy and yellow, and from its
    boiling and wild character and uncommon colour, a stranger would think,
    even in its lowest state, that there was a freshet upon it.</p>

  <p>For the distance of 1000 miles above <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, the shores of this
    river (and, in many places, the whole bed of the stream) are filled
    with snags and raft, formed of trees of the largest size, which have
    been undermined by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> falling banks and cast into the stream;
    their roots becoming fastened in the bottom of the river, with their
    tops floating on the surface of the water, and pointing down the
    stream, forming the most frightful and discouraging prospect for the
    adventurous voyageur. (See <a href="#i_004"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 4</a>.)</p>

  <p>Almost every island and sand-bar is covered with huge piles of these
    floating trees, and when the river is flooded, its surface is almost
    literally covered with floating raft and drift wood which bid positive
    defiance to keel-boats and steamers, on their way up the river.</p>

  <p>With what propriety this “Hell of waters” might he denominated the
    “River Styx,” I will not undertake to decide; but nothing could be more
    appropriate or innocent than to call it the River <em>of Sticks</em>.</p>

  <p>The scene is not, however, all so dreary; there is a redeeming beauty
    in the green and carpeted shores, which hem in this huge and terrible
    deformity of waters. There is much of the way though, where the mighty
    forests of stately cotton wood stand, and frown in horrid dark and
    coolness over the filthy abyss below; into which they are ready to
    plunge headlong, when the mud and soil in which they were germed and
    reared have been washed out from underneath them, and with the rolling
    current are mixed, and on their way to the ocean.</p>

  <p>The greater part of the shores of this river, however, are without
    timber, where the eye is delightfully relieved by wandering over the
    beautiful prairies; most of the way gracefully sloping down to the
    water’s edge, carpeted with the deepest green, and, in distance,
    softening into velvet of the richest hues, entirely beyond the reach
    of the artist’s pencil. Such is the character of the upper part of the
    river especially; and as one advances towards its source, and through
    its upper half, it becomes more pleasing to the eye, for snags and raft
    are no longer to be seen; yet the current holds its stiff and onward
    turbid character.</p>

  <p>It has been, heretofore, very erroneously represented to the world,
    that the scenery on this river was monotonous, and wanting in
    picturesque beauty. This intelligence is surely incorrect, and that
    because it has been brought perhaps, by men who are not the best
    judges in the world, of Nature’s beautiful works; and if they were,
    they always pass them by, in pain or desperate distress, in toil and
    trembling fear for the safety of their furs and peltries, or for their
    lives, which are at the mercy of the yelling savages who inhabit this
    delightful country.</p>

  <p>One thousand miles or more of the upper part of the river, was, to
    my eye, like fairy-land; and during our transit through that part of
    our voyage, I was most of the time rivetted to the deck of the boat,
    indulging my eyes in the boundless and tireless pleasure of roaming
    over the thousand hills, and bluffs, and dales, and ravines; where the
    astonished herds of buffaloes, of elks, and antelopes, and sneaking
    wolves, and mountain-goats, were to be seen bounding up and down and
    over the green fields; each one and each tribe, band, and gang, taking
    their own way, and using their own means to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> the greatest advantage
    possible, to leave the sight and sound of the puffing of our boat;
    which was, for the first time, saluting the green and wild shores of
    the Missouri with the din of mighty steam.</p>

  <p>From <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis to the falls of the Missouri, a distance of 2600 miles,
    is one continued prairie; with the exception of a few of the bottoms
    formed along the bank of the river, and the streams which are falling
    into it, which are often covered with the most luxuriant growth of
    forest timber.</p>

  <p>The summit level of the great prairies stretching off to the west and
    the east from the river, to an almost boundless extent, is from two to
    three hundred feet above the level of the river; which has formed a bed
    or valley for its course, varying in width from two to twenty miles.
    This channel or valley has been evidently produced by the force of the
    current, which has gradually excavated, in its floods and gorges, this
    immense space, and sent its débris into the ocean. By the continual
    overflowing of the river, its deposits have been lodged and left with a
    horizontal surface, spreading the deepest and richest alluvion over the
    surface of its meadows on either side; through which the river winds
    its serpentine course, alternately running from one bluff to the other,
    which present themselves to its shores in all the most picturesque and
    beautiful shapes and colours imaginable—some with their green sides
    gracefully slope down in the most lovely groups to the water’s edge
    (<a href="#i_005"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 5</a>); whilst others, divested of their verdure, present
    themselves in immense masses of clay of different colours, which arrest
    the eye of the traveller, with the most curious views in the world.</p>

  <p>These strange and picturesque appearances have been produced by the
    rains and frosts, which are continually changing the dimensions, and
    varying the thousand shapes of these denuded hills, by washing down
    their sides and carrying them into the river.</p>

  <p>Amongst these groups may be seen tens and hundreds of thousands of
    different forms and figures, of the sublime and the picturesque; in
    many places for miles together, as the boat glides along, there is
    one continued appearance, before and behind us, of some ancient and
    boundless city in ruins—ramparts, terraces, domes, towers, citadels
    and castles may be seen,—cupolas, and magnificent porticos, and here
    and there a solitary column and crumbling pedestal, and even spires
    of clay which stand alone—and glistening in distance, as the sun’s
    rays are refracted back by the thousand crystals of gypsum which are
    imbedded in the clay of which they are formed (<a href="#i_006"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 6</a>). Over
    and through these groups of domes and battlements (as one is compelled
    to imagine them), the sun sends his long and gilding rays, at morn or
    in the evening; giving life and light, by aid of shadows cast, to the
    different glowing colours of these clay-built ruins; shedding a glory
    over the solitude of this wild and pictured country, which no one can
    realize unless he travels here and looks upon it.</p>

  <p>It is amidst these wild and quiet haunts that the mountain-sheep, and
    the fleet-bounding antelope sport and live in herds, secure from their
    enemies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> to whom the sides and slopes of these bluffs (around which
    they fearlessly bound) are nearly inaccessible.</p>

  <p>The grizzly bear also has chosen these places for his abode; he
    sullenly sneaks through the gulphs and chasms, and ravines, and frowns
    away the lurking Indian; whilst the mountain-sheep and antelope are
    bounding over and around the hill tops, safe and free from harm of man
    and beast.</p>

  <p>Such is a hasty sketch of the river scenes and scenery for 2000 miles,
    over which we tugged, and puffed, and blowed, and toiled for three
    months, before we reached this place. Since we arrived here, the
    steamer has returned and left me here to explore the country and visit
    the tribes in this vicinity, and then descend the river from this place
    to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis; which Tour, if I live through it, will furnish material
    for many a story and curious incident, which I may give you in detail
    in future epistles, and when I have more leisure than I have at the
    present moment. I will then undertake to tell how we astonished the
    natives, in many an instance, which I can in this Letter but just
    hint at and say adieu. If anything did ever literally and completely
    “astonish (and astound) the natives,” it was the appearance of our
    steamer, puffing and blowing, and paddling and rushing by their
    villages which were on the banks of the river.</p>

  <p>These poor and ignorant people for the distance of 2000 miles, had
    never before seen or heard of a steam-boat, and in some places they
    seemed at a loss to know what to do, or how to act; they could not,
    as the Dutch did at Newburgh, on the Hudson River, take it to be a
    “<em>floating saw-mill</em>”—and they had no name for it—so it was, like
    every thing else (with them), which is mysterious and unaccountable,
    called <em>medicine</em> (mystery). We had on board one twelve-pound
    cannon and three or four eight-pound swivels, which we were taking up
    to arm the Fur Company’s Fort at the mouth of Yellow Stone, and at the
    approach to every village they were all discharged several times in
    rapid succession, which threw the inhabitants into utter confusion and
    amazement—some of them laid their faces to the ground, and cried to
    the Great Spirit—some shot their horses and dogs, and sacrificed them
    to appease the Great Spirit, whom they conceived was offended—some
    deserted their villages and ran to the tops of the bluffs some miles
    distant; and others, in some places, as the boat landed in front of
    their villages, came with great caution, and peeped over the bank of
    the river to see the fate of their chiefs whose duty it was (from the
    nature of their office) to approach us, whether friends or foes, and
    to go on board. Sometimes, in this plight, they were instantly thrown
    ‘neck and heels’ over each other’s heads and shoulders—men, women
    and children, and dogs—sage, sachem, old and young—all in a mass, at
    the frightful discharge of the steam from the escape-pipe, which the
    captain of the boat let loose upon them for his own fun and amusement.</p>

  <p>There were many curious conjectures amongst their wise men, with regard
    to the nature and powers of the steam-boat. Amongst the Mandans, some
    called it the “big thunder canoe;” for when in distance below the
    village,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> they saw the lightning flash from its sides, and heard
    the thunder come from it; others called it the “big medicine canoe
    with eyes;” it was <em>medicine</em> (mystery) because they could not
    understand it; and it must have eyes, for said they, “it sees its own
    way, and takes the deep water in the middle of the channel.”</p>

  <p>They had no idea of the boat being steered by the man at the wheel, and
    well they might have been astonished at its taking the deepest water. I
    may (if I do not forget it) hereafter give you an account of some other
    curious incidents of this kind, which we met with in this voyage; for
    we met many, and some of them were really laughable.</p>

  <p>The Fort in which I am residing was built by Mr. M‘Kenzie, who now
    occupies it. It is the largest and best-built establishment of the kind
    on the river, being the great or principal head-quarters and depôt
    of the Fur Company’s business in this region. A vast stock of goods
    is kept on hand at this place; and at certain times of the year the
    numerous out-posts concentrate here with the returns of their season’s
    trade, and refit out with a fresh supply of goods to trade with the
    Indians.</p>

  <p>The site for the Fort is well selected, being a beautiful prairie
    on the bank near the junction of the Missouri with the Yellow Stone
    rivers; and its inmates and its stores well protected from Indian
    assaults.</p>

  <p>Mr. M‘Kenzie is a kind-hearted and high-minded Scotchman; and seems to
    have charge of all the Fur Companies’ business in this region, and from
    this to the Rocky Mountains. He lives in good and comfortable style,
    inside of the Fort, which contains some eight or ten log-houses and
    stores, and has generally forty or fifty men, and one hundred and fifty
    horses about him.</p>

  <p>He has, with the same spirit of liberality and politeness with
    which Mons. Pierre Chouteau treated me on my passage up the river,
    pronounced me welcome at his table, which groans under the luxuries of
    the country; with buffalo meat and tongues, with beavers’ tails and
    marrow-fat; but <i>sans</i> coffee, <i>sans</i> bread and butter. Good
    cheer and good living we get at it however, and good wine also; for a
    bottle of Madeira and one of excellent Port are set in a pail of ice
    every day, and exhausted at dinner.</p>

  <p>At the hospitable board of this gentleman I found also another, who
    forms a happy companion for <em>mine host</em>; and whose intellectual
    and polished society has added not a little to <em>my</em> pleasure and
    amusement since I arrived here.</p>

  <p>The gentleman of whom I am speaking is an Englishman, by the name
    of Hamilton, of the most pleasing and entertaining conversation,
    whose mind seems to be a complete store-house of ancient and modern
    literature and art; and whose free and familiar acquaintance with the
    manners and men of his country gives him the stamp of a gentleman, who
    has had the curiosity to bring the embellishments of the enlightened
    world, to contrast with the rude and the wild of these remote regions.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

  <p>We three <i lang="fr">bons vivants</i> form the group about the dinner-table,
    of which I have before spoken, and crack our jokes and fun over the
    bottles of Port and Madeira, which I have named; and a considerable
    part of which, this gentleman has brought with great and precious care
    from his own country.</p>

  <p>This post is the general rendezvous of a great number of Indian tribes
    in these regions, who are continually concentrating here for the
    purpose of trade; sometimes coming, the whole tribe together, in a
    mass. There are now here, and encamped about the Fort, a great many,
    and I am continually at work with my brush; we have around us at this
    time the Knisteneaux, Crows, Assinneboins and Blackfeet, and in a few
    days are to have large accessions.</p>

  <p>The finest specimens of Indians on the Continent are in these regions;
    and before I leave these parts, I shall make excursions into their
    respective countries, to their own native fire-sides; and there study
    their looks and peculiar customs; enabling me to drop you now and then
    an interesting Letter. The tribes which I shall be enabled to see and
    study by my visit to this region, are the Ojibbeways, the Assinneboins,
    Knisteneaux, Blackfeet, Crows, Shiennes, Grosventres, Mandans, and
    others; of whom and their customs, their history, traditions, costumes,
    &amp;c., I shall in due season, give you further and minute accounts.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MOUTH OF YELLOW STONE.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> several tribes of Indians inhabiting the regions of the Upper
    Missouri, and of whom I spoke in my last Letter, are undoubtedly the
    finest looking, best equipped, and most beautifully costumed of any on
    the Continent. They live in a country well-stocked with buffaloes and
    wild horses, which furnish them an excellent and easy living; their
    atmosphere is pure, which produces good health and long life; and they
    are the most independent and the happiest races of Indians I have met
    with: they are all entirely in a state of primitive wildness, and
    consequently are picturesque and handsome, almost beyond description.
    Nothing in the world, of its kind, can possibly surpass in beauty and
    grace, some of their games and amusements—their gambols and parades, of
    which I shall speak and paint hereafter.</p>

  <p>As far as my travels have yet led me into the Indian country, I have
    more than realized my former predictions that those Indians who could
    be found most entirely in a state of nature, with the least knowledge
    of civilized society, would be found to be the most cleanly in their
    persons, elegant in their dress and manners, and enjoying life to the
    greatest perfection. Of such tribes, perhaps the Crows and Blackfeet
    stand first; and no one would be able to appreciate the richness and
    elegance (and even taste too), with which some of these people dress,
    without seeing them in their own country. I will do all I can, however,
    to make their looks as well as customs known to the world; I will paint
    with my brush and scribble with my pen, and bring their plumes and
    plumage, dresses, weapons, &amp;c., and every thing but the Indian himself,
    to prove to the world the assertions which I have made above.</p>

  <p>Every one of these red sons of the forest (or rather of the prairie)
    is a knight and lord—his squaws are his slaves; the only things which
    he deems worthy of his exertions are to mount his snorting steed, with
    his bow and quiver slung, his arrow-shield upon his arm, and his long
    lance glistening in the war-parade; or, divested of all his plumes and
    trappings, armed with a simple bow and quiver, to plunge his steed
    amongst the flying herds of buffaloes, and with his sinewy bow, which
    he seldom bends in vain, to drive deep to life’s fountain the whizzing
    arrow.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

  <p>The buffalo herds, which graze in almost countless numbers on these
    beautiful prairies, afford them an abundance of meat; and so much is
    it preferred to all other, that the deer, the elk, and the antelope
    sport upon the prairies in herds in the greatest security; as the
    Indians seldom kill them, unless they want their skins for a dress.
    The buffalo (or more correctly speaking bison) is a noble animal,
    that roams over the vast prairies, from the borders of Mexico on the
    south, to Hudson’s Bay on the north. Their size is somewhat above
    that of our common bullock, and their flesh of a delicious flavour,
    resembling and equalling that of fat beef. Their flesh which is easily
    procured, furnishes the savages of these vast regions the means of a
    wholesome and good subsistence, and they live almost exclusively upon
    it—converting the skins, horns, hoofs and bones, to the construction
    of dresses, shields, bows, &amp;c. The buffalo bull is one of the most
    formidable and frightful looking animals in the world when excited to
    resistance; his long shaggy mane hangs in great profusion over his neck
    and shoulders and often extends quite down to the ground (<a href="#i_007"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    7</a>). The cow is less in stature, and less ferocious; though not
    much less wild and frightful in her appearance (<a href="#i_008"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 8</a>).</p>

  <p>The mode in which these Indians kill this noble animal is spirited and
    thrilling in the extreme; and I must in a future epistle, give you
    a minute account of it. I have almost daily accompanied parties of
    Indians to see the fun, and have often shared in it myself; but much
    oftener ran my horse by their sides, to see how the thing was done—to
    study the modes and expressions of these splendid scenes, which I am
    industriously putting upon the canvass.</p>

  <p>They are all (or nearly so) killed with arrows and the lance, while at
    full speed; and the reader may easily imagine, that these scenes afford
    the most spirited and picturesque views of the sporting kind that can
    possibly be seen.</p>

  <p>At present, I will give a little sketch of a bit of fun I joined in
    yesterday, with Mr. M‘Kenzie and a number of his men, without the
    company or aid of Indians.</p>

  <p>I mentioned the other day, that M‘Kenzie’s table from day to day
    groans under the weight of buffalo tongues and beavers’ tails, and
    other luxuries of this western land. He has within his Fort a spacious
    ice-house, in which he preserves his meat fresh for any length of time
    required; and sometimes, when his larder runs low. he starts out,
    rallying some five or six of his best hunters (not to hunt, but to “go
    for meat”). He leads the party, mounted on his favourite buffalo horse
    (<i>i. e.</i> the horse amongst his whole group which is best trained
    to run the buffalo), trailing a light and short gun in his hand, such
    an one as he can most easily reload whilst his horse is at full speed.</p>

  <p>Such was the condition of the ice-house yesterday morning, which caused
    these self-catering gentlemen to cast their eyes with a wishful look
    over the prairies; and such was the plight in which our host took
    the lead, and I,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> and then Mons. Chardon, and Ba’tiste Défonde and
    Tullock (who is a trader amongst the Crows, and is here at this time,
    with a large party of that tribe), and there were several others whose
    names I do not know.</p>

  <p>As we were mounted and ready to start, M‘Kenzie called up some four
    or five of his men, and told them to follow immediately on our trail,
    with as many one-horse carts, which they were to harness up, to bring
    home the meat; “ferry them across the river in the scow,” said he,
    “and following our trail through the bottom, you will find us on the
    plain yonder, between the Yellow Stone and the Missouri rivers, with
    meat enough to load you home. My watch on yonder bluff has just told
    us by his signals, that there are cattle a plenty on that spot, and we
    are going there as fast as possible.” We all crossed the river, and
    galloped away a couple of miles or so, when we mounted the bluff; and
    to be sure, as was said, there was in full view of us a fine herd of
    some four or five hundred buffaloes, perfectly at rest, and in their
    own estimation (probably) perfectly secure. Some were grazing, and
    others were lying down and sleeping; we advanced within a mile or so
    of them in full view, and came to a halt. Mons. Chardon “tossed the
    feather” (a custom always observed, to try the course of the wind),
    and we commenced “stripping” as it is termed (<i>i. e.</i> every man
    strips himself and his horse of every extraneous and unnecessary
    appendage of dress, &amp;c. that might be an incumbrance in running): hats
    are laid off, and coats—and bullet pouches; sleeves are rolled up,
    a handkerchief tied tightly around the head, and another around the
    waist—cartridges are prepared and placed in the waistcoat pocket, or
    a half dozen bullets “throwed into the mouth,” &amp;c., &amp;c., all of which
    takes up some ten or fifteen minutes, and is not, in appearance or
    in effect, unlike a council of war. Our leader lays the whole plan
    of the chase, and preliminaries all fixed, guns charged and ramrods
    in our hands, we mount and start for the onset. The horses are all
    trained for this business, and seem to enter into it with as much
    enthusiasm, and with as restless a spirit as the riders themselves.
    While “stripping” and mounting, they exhibit the most restless
    impatience; and when “approaching”—(which is, all of us abreast,
    upon a slow walk, and in a straight line towards the herd, until
    they discover us and run), they all seem to have caught entirely the
    spirit of the chase, for the laziest nag amongst them prances with
    an elasticity in his step—champing his bit—his ears erect—his eyes
    strained out of his head, and fixed upon the game before him, whilst
    he trembles under the saddle of his rider. In this way we carefully
    and silently marched, until within some forty or fifty rods; when the
    herd discovering us, wheeled and laid their course in a mass. At this
    instant we started! (and all <em>must</em> start, for no one could check
    the fury of those steeds at that moment of excitement,) and away all
    sailed, and over the prairie flew, in a cloud of dust which was raised
    by their trampling hoofs. M‘Kenzie was foremost in the throng, and
    soon dashed off amidst the dust and was out of sight—he was after the
    fattest and the fastest. I had discovered a huge bull whose shoulders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
    towered above the whole band, and I picked my way through the crowd to
    get alongside of him. I went not for “meat,” but for a <em>trophy</em>;
    I wanted his head and horns. I dashed along through the thundering
    mass, as they swept away over the plain, scarcely able to tell whether
    I was on a buffalo’s back or my horse—hit, and hooked, and jostled
    about, till at length I found myself alongside of my game, when I gave
    him a shot, as I passed him. I saw guns flash in several directions
    about me, but I heard them not. Amidst the trampling throng, Mons.
    Chardon had wounded a stately bull, and at this moment was passing
    him again with his piece levelled for another shot; they were both
    at full speed and I also, within the reach of the muzzle of my gun,
    when the bull instantly turned and receiving the horse upon his horns,
    and the ground received poor Chardon, who made a frog’s leap of some
    twenty feet or more over the bull’s back (<a href="#i_009"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 9</a>), and almost
    under my horse’s heels. I wheeled my horse as soon as possible and
    rode back, where lay poor Chardon, gasping to start his breath again;
    and within a few paces of him his huge victim, with his heels high
    in the air, and the horse lying across him. I dismounted instantly,
    but Chardon was raising himself on his hands, with his eyes and
    mouth full of dirt, and feeling for his gun, which lay about thirty
    feet in advance of him. “Heaven spare you! are you hurt, Chardon?”
    “hi—hic——hic———hic————hic—————hic——————no,——hic———no——no, I
    believe not. Oh! this is not much, Mons. Cataline—this is nothing
    new—but this is a d——d hard piece of ground here—hic—oh! hic!” At this
    the poor fellow fainted, but in a few moments arose, picked up his gun,
    took his horse by the bit; which then opened <em>its</em> eyes, and with
    a <em>hic</em> and a <em>ugh</em>—<span class="allsmcap">UGHK</span>! sprang upon its feet—shook
    off the dirt—and here we were, all upon our legs again, save the bull,
    whose fate had been more sad than that of either.</p>

  <p>I turned my eyes in the direction where the herd had gone, and
    our companions in pursuit, and nothing could be seen of them, nor
    indication, except the cloud of dust which they left behind them.
    At a little distance on the right, however, I beheld my huge victim
    endeavouring to make as much head-way as he possibly could, from this
    dangerous ground, upon three legs. I galloped off to him, and at my
    approach he wheeled around—and bristled up for battle; he seemed to
    know perfectly well that he could not escape from me, and resolved to
    meet his enemy and death as bravely as possible.</p>

  <p>I found that my shot had entered him a little too far forward, breaking
    one of his shoulders, and lodging in his breast, and from his very
    great weight it was impossible for him to make much advance upon me.
    As I rode up within a few paces of him, he would bristle up with fury
    enough in his <em>looks</em> alone, almost to annihilate me (<a href="#i_010"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    10</a>); and making one lunge at me, would fall upon his neck and
    nose, so that I found the sagacity of my horse alone enough to keep
    me out of reach of danger: and I drew from my pocket my sketch-book,
    laid my gun across my lap, and commenced taking his likeness. He stood
    stiffened up, and swelling with awful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> vengeance, which was sublime
    for a picture, but which he could not vent upon me. I rode around him
    and sketched him in numerous attitudes, sometimes he would lie down,
    and I would then sketch him; then throw my cap at him, and rousing him
    on his legs, rally a new expression, and sketch him again.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>6</i></div>

    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_010.jpg" alt="" />
     <figcaption>10</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>In this way I added to my sketch-book some invaluable sketches of
    this grim-visaged monster, who knew not that he was standing for his
    likeness.</p>

  <p>No man on earth can imagine what is the look and expression of such a
    subject before him as this was. I defy the world to produce another
    animal than can look so frightful as a huge buffalo bull, when wounded
    as he was, turned around for battle, and swelling with rage;—his eyes
    bloodshot, and his long shaggy mane hanging to the ground,—his mouth
    open, and his horrid rage hissing in streams of smoke and blood from
    his mouth and through his nostrils, as he is bending forward to spring
    upon his assailant.</p>

  <p>After I had had the requisite time and opportunity for using my pencil,
    M‘Kenzie and his companions came walking their exhausted horses back
    from the chase, and in our rear came four or five carts to carry home
    the meat. The party met from all quarters around me and my buffalo
    bull, whom I then shot in the head and finished. And being seated
    together for a few minutes, each one took a smoke of the pipe, and
    recited his exploits, and his “coups” or deaths; when all parties had
    a hearty laugh at me, as a novice, for having aimed at an old bull,
    whose flesh was not suitable for food, and the carts were escorted on
    the trail, to bring away the meat. I rode back with Mr. M‘Kenzie, who
    pointed out five cows which he had killed, and all of them selected
    as the fattest and slickest of the herd. This astonishing feat was
    all performed within the distance of one mile—all were killed at full
    speed, and every one shot through the heart. In the short space of time
    required for a horse under “full whip,” to run the distance of one
    mile, he had discharged his gun five, and loaded it four times—selected
    his animals, and killed at every shot! There were six or eight others
    killed at the same time, which altogether furnished, as will be seen,
    abundance of freight for the carts; which returned, as well as several
    packhorses, loaded with the choicest parts which were cut from the
    animals, and the remainder of the carcasses left a prey for the wolves.</p>

  <p>Such is the mode by which white men live in this country—such the way
    in which they get their food, and such is one of their delightful
    amusements—at the hazard of every bone in one’s body, to feel the fine
    and thrilling exhilaration of the chase for a moment, and then as often
    to upbraid and blame himself for his folly and imprudence.</p>

  <p>From this scene we commenced leisurely wending our way back; and
    dismounting at the place where we had stripped, each man dressed
    himself again, or slung his extra articles of dress, &amp;c. across his
    saddle, astride of which he sat; and we rode back to the Fort, reciting
    as we rode, and for twenty-four hours afterwards, deeds of chivalry and
    chase, and hair’s-breadth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> escapes which each and either had fought
    and run on former occasions. M‘Kenzie, with all the true character
    and dignity of a leader, was silent on these subjects; but smiled,
    while those in his train were reciting for him the astonishing and
    almost incredible deeds of his sinewy arms, which they had witnessed
    in similar scenes; from which I learned (as well as from my own
    observations), that he was reputed (and actually <em>was</em>) the
    most distinguished of all the white men who have flourished in these
    regions, in the pursuit and death of the buffalo.</p>

  <p>On our return to the Fort, a bottle or two of wine were set forth
    upon the table, and around them a half dozen parched throats were
    soon moistened, and good cheer ensued. Ba’tiste Défonde, Chardon,
    &amp;c., retired to their quarters, enlarging smoothly upon the events
    of our morning’s work; which they were reciting to their wives and
    sweethearts; when about this time the gate of the Fort was thrown open,
    and the procession of carts and packhorses laden with buffalo meat made
    its entrée; gladdening the hearts of a hundred women and children,
    and tickling the noses of as many hungry dogs and puppies, who were
    stealing in and smelling at the tail of the procession. The door of the
    ice-house was thrown open, the meat was discharged into it, and I being
    fatigued, went to sleep.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MOUTH OF YELLOW STONE, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">In</span> my former epistle I told you there were encamped about the Fort
    a host of wild, incongruous spirits—chiefs and sachems—warriors,
    braves, and women and children of different tribes—of Crows and
    Blackfeet—Ojibbeways—Assinneboins—and Crees or Knisteneaux. Amongst
    and in the midst of them am I, with my paint pots and canvass, snugly
    ensconced in one of the bastions of the Fort, which I occupy as a
    painting-room. My easel stands before me, and the cool breech of a
    twelve-pounder makes me a comfortable seat, whilst her muzzle is
    looking out at one of the port-holes. The operations of my brush are
    <em>mysteries</em> of the highest order to these red sons of the prairie,
    and my room the earliest and latest place of concentration of these
    wild and jealous spirits, who all meet here to be amused and pay me
    signal honours; but gaze upon each other, sending their sidelong looks
    of deep-rooted hatred and revenge around the group. However, whilst in
    the Fort, their weapons are placed within the arsenal, and naught but
    looks and thoughts can be breathed here; but death and grim destruction
    will visit back those looks upon each other, when these wild spirits
    again are loose and free to breathe and act upon the plains.</p>

  <p>I have this day been painting a portrait of the head chief of the
    Blackfoot nation; he is a good-looking and dignified Indian, about
    fifty years of age, and superbly dressed (<a href="#i_011"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 11</a>); whilst
    sitting for his picture he has been surrounded by his own braves
    and warriors, and also gazed at by his enemies, the Crows and the
    Knisteneaux, Assinneboins and Ojibbeways; a number of distinguished
    personages of each of which tribes, have laid all day around the sides
    of my room; reciting to each other the battles they have fought, and
    pointing to the scalp-locks, worn as proofs of their victories, and
    attached to the seams of their shirts and leggings. This is a curious
    scene to witness, when one sits in the midst of such inflammable and
    combustible materials, brought together, unarmed, for the first time in
    their lives; peaceably and calmly recounting over the deeds of their
    lives, and smoking their pipes upon it, when a few weeks or days will
    bring them on the plains again, where the war-cry will be raised, and
    their deadly bows will again be drawn on each other.</p>

  <p>The name of this dignitary, of whom I have just spoken, is
    Stu-mick-o-sucks (the buffalo’s back fat), <i>i. e.</i> the “hump”
    or “fleece,” the most delicious part of the buffalo’s flesh. I
    have also painted, of the Blackfeet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> Pe-toh-pee-kiss (the eagle
    ribs), and Mix-ke-mote-skin-na (the iron horn), and Wun-nes-tou (the
    white buffalo), and Tcha-aes-sa-ko-mah-pee (the bear’s child), and
    In-ne-o-cose (the buffalo’s child), and half-a-dozen others, and all in
    rich and costly dresses.</p>

  <p>There is no tribe, perhaps, on the Continent, who dress more
    comfortably, and more gaudily, than the Blackfeet, unless it be
    the tribe of Crows. There is no great difference, however, in the
    costliness or elegance of their costumes; nor in the materials of which
    they are formed; though there is a distinctive mode in each tribe, of
    stitching or ornamenting with the porcupine quills, which constitute
    one of the principal ornaments to all their fine dresses; and which
    can be easily recognized, by any one a little familiar with their
    modes, as belonging to such or such a tribe. The dress, for instance of
    the chief whom I have just mentioned, and whose portrait I have just
    painted, consists of a shirt or tunic, made of two deer skins finely
    dressed, and so placed together with the necks of the skins downwards,
    and the skins of the hind legs stitched together, the seams running
    down on each arm, from the neck to the knuckles of the hand; this
    seam is covered with a band of two inches in width, of very beautiful
    embroidery of porcupine quills, and suspended from the under edge of
    this, from the shoulders to the hands, is a fringe of the locks of
    black hair, which he has taken from the heads of victims slain by his
    own hand in battle. The leggings are made also of the same material;
    and down the outer side of the leg, from the hip to the feet, extends
    also a similar band or belt of the same width; and wrought in the same
    manner, with porcupine quills, and fringed with scalp locks. These
    locks of hair are procured from scalps, and worn as trophies.</p>

  <p>The wife (or squaw) of this dignitary Eeh-nis-kin (the crystal
    stone), I have also placed upon my canvass (<a href="#i_013"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 13</a>); her
    countenance is rather pleasing, which is an uncommon thing amongst
    the Blackfeet—her dress is made of skins, and being the youngest of a
    bevy of six or eight, and the last one taken under his guardianship,
    was smiled upon with great satisfaction, whilst he exempted her from
    the drudgeries of the camp; and keeping her continually in the halo of
    his own person, watched and guarded her as the apple of his eye. The
    grandson also of this sachem, a boy of six years of age, and too young
    as yet to have acquired a name, has stood forth like a tried warrior;
    and I have painted him at full length (<a href="#i_012"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 12</a>), with his
    bow and quiver slung, and his robe made of a racoon skin. The history
    of this child is somewhat curious and interesting; his father is dead,
    and in case of the death of the chief, of whom I have spoken, he
    becomes hereditary chief of the tribe. This boy has been twice stolen
    away by the Crows by ingenious stratagems, and twice re-captured by
    the Blackfeet, at considerable sacrifice of life, and at present he is
    lodged with Mr. M‘Kenzie, for safe keeping and protection, until he
    shall arrive at the proper age to take the office to which he is to
    succeed, and able to protect himself.</p>

  <p>The scalp of which I spoke above, is procured by cutting out a piece
    of the skin of the head, the size of the palm of the hand or less,
    containing the very centre or crown of the head, the place where the
    hair radiates from a point, and exactly over what the phrenologists
    call self-esteem. This patch then is kept and dried with great care, as
    proof positive of the death of an enemy, and evidence of a man’s claims
    as a warrior; and after having been formally “danced,” as the saying
    is, (<i>i. e.</i> after it has been stuck up upon a pole or held up by
    an “old woman,” and the warriors have danced around it for two or three
    weeks at intervals,) it is fastened to the handle of a lance, or the
    end of a war-club, or divided into a great many small locks and used
    to fringe and ornament the victor’s dress. When these dresses are seen
    bearing such trophies, it is of course a difficult matter to purchase
    them of the Indian, for they often hold them above all price. I shall
    hereafter take occasion to speak of the scalp-dance; describing it in
    all its parts, and giving a long Letter, at the same time on scalps
    and scalping, an interesting and general custom amongst all the North
    American Indians.</p>

  <p>In the chief’s dress, which I am describing, there are his moccasins,
    made also of buckskin, and ornamented in a corresponding manner. And
    over all, his robe, made of the skin of a young buffalo bull, with
    the hair remaining on; and on the inner or flesh side, beautifully
    garnished with porcupine quills, and the battles of his life very
    ingeniously, though rudely, pourtrayed in pictorial representations.
    In his hand he holds a very beautiful pipe, the stem of which is four
    or five feet long, and two inches wide, curiously wound with braids
    of the porcupine quills of various colours; and the bowl of the pipe
    ingeniously carved by himself from a piece of red steatite of an
    interesting character, and which they all tell me is procured somewhere
    between this place and the Falls of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, on the head waters of
    the Mississippi.</p>

  <p>This curious stone has many peculiar qualities, and has, undoubtedly,
    but one origin in this country, and perhaps in the world. It is found
    but in the hands of the savage, and every tribe, and nearly every
    individual in the tribe has his pipe made of it. I consider this stone
    a subject of great interest, and curiosity to the world; and I shall
    most assuredly make it a point, during my Indian rambles, to visit the
    place from whence it is brought. I have already got a number of most
    remarkable traditions and stories relating to the “sacred quarry;”
    of pilgrimages performed there to procure the stone, and of curious
    transactions that have taken place on that ground. It seems, from all
    I can learn, that all the tribes in these regions, and also of the
    Mississippi and the Lakes, have been in the habit of going to that
    place, and meeting their enemies there, whom they are obliged to treat
    as friends, under an injunction of the Great Spirit.</p>

  <p>So then is this sachem (the buffalo’s back fat) dressed; and in a very
    similar manner, and almost the same, is each of the others above named;
    and all are armed with bow and quiver, lance and shield. These north-western<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
    tribes are all armed with the bow and lance, and protected with
    the shield or arrow fender, which is carried outside of the left arm,
    exactly as the Roman and Grecian shield was carried, and for the same
    purpose.</p>

  <p>There is an appearance purely classic in the plight and equipment of
    these warriors and “knights of the lance.” They are almost literally
    always on their horses’ backs, and they wield these weapons with
    desperate effect upon the open plains; where they kill their game
    while at full speed, and contend in like manner in battles with their
    enemy. There is one prevailing custom in these respects, amongst all
    the tribes who inhabit the great plains or prairies of these western
    regions. These plains afford them an abundance of wild and fleet
    horses, which are easily procured; and on their backs at full speed,
    they can come alongside of any animal, which they easily destroy.</p>

  <p>The bow with which they are armed is small, and apparently an
    insignificant weapon, though one of great and almost incredible power
    in the hands of its owner, whose sinews have been from childhood
    habituated to its use and service. The length of these bows is
    generally about three feet, and sometimes not more than two and a half
    (<a href="#i_018"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 18</a> <i>a</i>). They have, no doubt, studied to get
    the requisite power in the smallest compass possible, as it is more
    easily and handily used on horseback than one of greater length. The
    greater number of these bows are made of ash, or of “bois d’arc” (as
    the French call it), and lined on the back with layers of buffalo or
    deer’s sinews, which are inseparably attached to them, and give them
    great elasticity. There are very many also (amongst the Blackfeet
    and the Crows) which are made of bone, and others of the horn of the
    mountain-sheep. Those made of bone are decidedly the most valuable, and
    cannot in this country be procured of a good quality short of the price
    of one or two horses. About these there is a mystery yet to be solved,
    and I advance my opinion against all theories that I have heard in the
    country where they are used and made. I have procured several very fine
    specimens, and when purchasing them have inquired of the Indians, what
    bone they were made of? and in every instance, the answer was, “That’s
    medicine,” meaning that it was a mystery to them, or that they did not
    wish to be questioned about them. The bone of which they are made is
    certainly not the bone of any animal now grazing on the prairies, or
    in the mountains between this place and the Pacific Ocean; for some
    of these bows are three feet in length, of a solid piece of bone, and
    that as close-grained—as hard—as white, and as highly polished as
    any ivory; it cannot, therefore be made from the elks’ horn (as some
    have supposed), which is of a dark colour and porous: nor can it come
    from the buffalo. It is my opinion, therefore, that the Indians on
    the Pacific coast procure the bone from the jaw of the sperm whale,
    which is often stranded on that coast, and bringing the bone into the
    mountains, trade it to the Blackfeet and Crows, who manufacture it into
    these bows without knowing any more than we do, from what source it has
    been procured.</p>

  <p>One of these little bows in the hands of an Indian, on a fleet and
    well-trained horse, with a quiver of arrows slung on his back, is a
    most effective and powerful weapon in the open plains. No one can
    easily credit the force with which these missiles are thrown, and the
    sanguinary effects produced by their wounds, until he has rode by
    the side of a party of Indians in chase of a herd of buffaloes, and
    witnessed the apparent ease and grace with which their supple arms have
    drawn the bow, and seen these huge animals tumbling down and gushing
    out their hearts’ blood from their mouths and nostrils.</p>

  <p>Their bows are often made of bone and sinews, and their arrows headed
    with flints or with bones, of their own construction (<a href="#i_018"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    18</a>, <i>c</i>), or with steel, as they are now chiefly furnished
    by the Fur Traders quite to the Rocky Mountains (<a href="#i_018"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 18</a>,
    <i>d</i>). The quiver, which is uniformly carried on the back, and
    made of the panther or otter skins (<a href="#i_018"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 18</a>, <i>e</i>) is a
    magazine of these deadly weapons, and generally contains two varieties.
    The one to be drawn upon an enemy, generally poisoned, and with long
    flukes or barbs, which are designed to hang the blade in the wound
    after the shaft is withdrawn, in which they are but slightly glued;—the
    other to be used for their game, with the blade firmly fastened to the
    shaft, and the flukes inverted; that it may easily be drawn from the
    wound, and used on a future occasion.</p>

  <p>Such is the training of men and horses in this country, that this work
    of death and slaughter is simple and easy. The horse is trained to
    approach the animals on the <em>right</em> side, enabling its rider to
    throw his arrows to the left; it runs and approaches without the use
    of the halter, which is hanging loose upon its neck bringing the rider
    within three or four paces of the animal, when the arrow is thrown with
    great ease and certainty to the heart; and instances sometimes occur,
    where the arrow passes entirely through the animal’s body.</p>

  <p>An Indian, therefore, mounted on a fleet and well-trained horse, with
    his bow in his hand, and his quiver slung on his back, containing an
    hundred arrows, of which he can throw fifteen or twenty in a minute, is
    a formidable and dangerous enemy. Many of them also ride with a lance
    of twelve or fourteen feet in length (<a href="#i_018"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 18</a>, <i>b</i>),
    with a blade of polished steel; and all of them (as a protection
    for their vital parts), with a shield or arrow-fender made of the
    skin of the buffalo’s neck, which has been smoked, and hardened with
    glue extracted from the hoofs (<a href="#i_018"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 18</a>). These shields are
    arrow-proof, and will glance off a rifle shot with perfect effect by
    being turned obliquely, which they do with great skill.</p>

  <p>This shield or arrow-fender is, in my opinion, made of similar
    materials, and used in the same way, and for the same purpose, as was
    the clypeus or small shield in the Roman and Grecian cavalry. They were
    made in those days as a means of defence on horseback only—made small
    and light, of bull’s hides; sometimes single, sometimes double and
    tripled. Such was Hector’s shield, and of most of the Homeric heroes of
    the Greek and Trojan wars. In those days also were darts or javelins
    and lances; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> same were also used by the Ancient Britons; and such
    exactly are now in use amongst the Arabs and the North American Indians.</p>

  <p>In this wise then, are all of these wild red knights of the prairie,
    armed and equipped,—and while nothing can possibly be more picturesque
    and thrilling than a troop or war-party of these fellows, galloping
    over these green and endless prairies; there can be no set of mounted
    men of equal numbers, so effective and so invincible in this country
    as they would be, could they be inspired with confidence of their own
    powers and their own superiority; yet this never can be done;—for the
    Indian, as far as the name of white man has travelled, and long before
    he has to try his strength with him, is trembling with fright and fear
    of his approach; he hears of white man’s arts and artifice—his tricks
    and cunning, and his hundred instruments of death and destruction—he
    dreads his approach, shrinks from him with fear and trembling—his
    heart sickens, and his pride and courage wither, at the thoughts of
    contending with an enemy, whom he thinks may war and destroy with
    weapons of <em>medicine</em> or mystery.</p>

  <p>Of the Blackfeet, whom I mentioned in the beginning of this Letter,
    and whose portraits are now standing in my room, there is another of
    whom I must say a few words; Pe-toh-pee-kiss, the eagle ribs (<a href="#i_015"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    14</a>). This man is one of the extraordinary men of the Blackfoot
    tribe; though not a chief, he stands here in the Fort, and deliberately
    boasts of eight scalps, which he says he has taken from the heads of
    trappers and traders with his own hand. His dress is really superb,
    almost literally covered with scalp-locks, of savage and civil.</p>

  <p>I have painted him at full length, with a head-dress made entirely
    of ermine skins and horns of the buffalo. This custom of wearing
    horns beautifully polished and surmounting the head-dress, is a very
    curious one, being worn only by the bravest of the brave; by the most
    extraordinary men in the nation. Of their importance and meaning, I
    shall say more in a future epistle. When he stood for his picture, he
    also held a lance and two “medicine-bags” in his hand; of lances I have
    spoken,—but “medicine-bags” and “medicine” will be the text for my next
    Letter.</p>

  <p>Besides the chiefs and warriors above-named, I have also
    transferred to my canvass the “looks and very resemblance”
    of an aged chief, who combines with his high office, the
    envied title of mystery or medicine-man, <i>i. e.</i>
    doctor—magician—prophet—soothsayer—jongleur—and high priest, all
    combined in one person, who necessarily is looked upon as “Sir
    Oracle” of the nation. The name of this distinguished functionary is
    Wun-nes-tou, the white buffalo (<a href="#i_015"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 15</a>); and on his left arm
    he presents his mystery-drum or tambour, in which are concealed the
    hidden and sacred mysteries of his healing art.</p>

  <p>And there is also In-ne-o-cose, the iron-horn (<a href="#i_016"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 16</a>), at
    full length, in a splendid dress, with his “medicine-bag” in his hand;
    and Ah-kay-ee-pix-en, the woman who strikes many (<a href="#i_017"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 17</a>),
    in a beautiful dress of the mountain-goats’ skin, and her robe of the
    young buffalo’s hide.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Now</span> for medicines or mysteries—for doctors, high-priests, for hocus
    pocus, witchcraft, and animal magnetism!</p>

  <p>In the last Letter I spoke of Pe-toh-pee-kiss (the eagle ribs), a
    Blackfoot brave, whose portrait I had just painted at full length, in
    a splendid dress. I mentioned also, that he held two medicine-bags in
    his hand; as they are represented in the picture; both of them made of
    the skins of otters, and curiously ornamented with ermine, and other
    strange things.</p>

  <p>I must needs stop here—my painting and every thing else, until I can
    explain the word “<em>medicine</em>,” and “<em>medicine-bag</em>;” and
    also some <em>medicine operations</em>, which I have seen transacted at
    this place within a few days past. “Medicine” is a great word in this
    country; and it is very necessary that one should know the meaning of
    it, whilst he is scanning and estimating the Indian character, which is
    made up, in a great degree, of mysteries and superstitions.</p>

  <p>The word medicine, in its common acceptation here, means
    <em>mystery</em>, and nothing else; and in that sense I <em>shall</em> use
    it very frequently in my Notes on Indian Manners and Customs.</p>

  <p>The Fur Traders in this country, are nearly all French; and in their
    language, a doctor or physician, is called “<i lang="fr">Medecin</i>.” The Indian
    country is full of doctors; and as they are all magicians, and skilled,
    or profess to be skilled, in many mysteries, the word “medecin” has
    become habitually applied to every thing mysterious or unaccountable;
    and the English and Americans, who are also trading and passing through
    this country, have easily and familiarly adopted the same word, with
    a slight alteration, conveying the same meaning; and to be a little
    more explicit, they have denominated these personages “medicine-men,”
    which means something more than merely a doctor or physician. These
    physicians, however, are all <em>medicine-men</em>, as they are all
    supposed to deal more or less in mysteries and charms, which are aids
    and handmaids in their practice. Yet it was necessary to give the
    word or phrase a still more comprehensive meaning—as there were many
    personages amongst them, and also amongst the white men who visit
    the country, who could deal in mysteries, though not skilled in the
    application of drugs and medicines; and they all range now, under the
    comprehensive and accommodating phrase of “medicine-men.” For instance,
    I am a “medicine-man” of the highest order amongst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> these superstitious
    people, on account of the art which I practice; which is a strange and
    unaccountable thing to them, and of course, called the greatest of
    “medicine.” My gun and pistols, which have percussion-locks, are great
    medicine; and no Indian can be prevailed on to fire them off, for they
    say they have nothing to do with white man’s medicine.</p>

  <p>The Indians do not use the word medicine, however; but in each tribe
    they have a word of their own construction, synonimous with mystery or
    mystery-man.</p>

  <p>The “medicine-bag” then, is a mystery-bag; and its meaning and
    importance necessary to be understood, as it may be said to be the
    key to Indian life and Indian character. These bags are constructed
    of the skins of animals, of birds, or of reptiles, and ornamented and
    preserved in a thousand different ways, as suits the taste or freak of
    the person who constructs them. These skins are generally attached to
    some part of the clothing of the Indian, or carried in his hand—they
    are oftentimes decorated in such a manner as to be exceedingly
    ornamental to his person, and always are stuffed with grass, or moss,
    or something of the kind; and generally without drugs or medicines
    within them, as they are religiously closed and sealed, and seldom, if
    ever, to be opened. I find that every Indian in his primitive state,
    carries his medicine-bag in some form or other, to which he pays the
    greatest homage, and to which he looks for safety and protection
    through life—and in fact, it might almost be called a species of
    idolatry; for it would seem in some instances, as if he actually
    worshipped it. Feasts are often made, and dogs and horses sacrificed,
    to a man’s medicine; and days, and even weeks, of fasting and penance
    of various kinds are often suffered, to appease his medicine, which he
    imagines he has in some way offended.</p>

  <p>This curious custom has principally been done away with along the
    frontier, where white men laugh at the Indian for the observance of so
    ridiculous and useless a form; but in this country it is in full force,
    and every male in the tribe carries this, his supernatural charm or
    guardian, to which he looks for the preservation of his life, in battle
    or in other danger; at which times it would be considered ominous of
    bad luck and an ill fate to be without it.</p>

  <p>The manner in which this curious and important article is instituted
    is this: a boy, at the age of fourteen or fifteen years, is said to
    be making or “forming his medicine,” when he wanders away from his
    father’s lodge, and absents himself for the space of two or three, and
    sometimes even four or five, days; lying on the ground in some remote
    or secluded spot, crying to the Great Spirit, and fasting the whole
    time. During this period of peril and abstinence, when he falls asleep,
    the first animal, bird, or reptile, of which he dreams (or pretends to
    have dreamed, perhaps), he considers the Great Spirit has designated
    for his mysterious protector through life. He then returns home to
    his father’s lodge, and relates his success; and after allaying his
    thirst, and satiating his appetite, he sallies forth with weapons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span> or
    traps, until he can procure the animal or bird, the skin of which he
    preserves entire, and ornaments it according to his own fancy, and
    carries it with him through life, for “good luck” (as he calls it); as
    his strength in battle—and in death his guardian <em>Spirit</em>, that
    is buried with him, and which is to conduct him safe to the beautiful
    hunting grounds, which he contemplates in the world to come.</p>

  <p>The value of the medicine-bag to the Indian is beyond all price; for
    to sell it, or give it away, would subject him to such signal disgrace
    in his tribe, that he could never rise above it; and again, his
    superstition would stand in the way of any such disposition of it, for
    he considers it the gift of the Great Spirit. An Indian carries his
    <em>medicine-bag</em> into battle, and trusts to it for his protection;
    and if he loses it thus, when fighting ever so bravely for his country,
    he suffers a disgrace scarcely less than that which occurs in case he
    sells or gives it away; his enemy carries it off and displays it to his
    own people as a trophy; whilst the loser is cut short of the respect
    that is due to other young men of his tribe, and for ever subjected
    to the degrading epithet of “a man without medicine,” or “he who has
    lost his medicine,” until he can replace it again; which can only be
    done, by rushing into battle and plundering one from an enemy whom he
    slays with his own hand. This done, his medicine is restored, and he
    is reinstated again in the estimation of his tribe; and even higher
    than before, for such is called the best of medicine, or “<em>medicine
     honourable</em>.”</p>

  <p>It is a singular fact, that a man can institute his mystery or
    medicine, but once in his life; and equally singular that he can
    reinstate himself by the adoption of the medicine of his enemy; both
    of which regulations are strong and violent inducements for him to
    fight bravely in battle: the first, that he may protect and preserve
    his medicine; and the second, in case he has been so unlucky as to
    lose it, that he may restore it, and his reputation also, while he is
    desperately contending for the protection of his community.</p>

  <p>During my travels thus far, I have been unable to buy a medicine-bag of
    an Indian, although I have offered them extravagant prices for them;
    and even on the frontier, where they have been induced to abandon the
    practice, though a white man may induce an Indian to relinquish his
    medicine, yet he cannot <em>buy</em> it of him—the Indian in such case
    will bury it, to please a white man, and save it from his sacrilegious
    touch; and he will linger around the spot and at regular times visit it
    and pay it his devotions, as long as he lives.</p>

  <p>These curious appendages to the persons or wardrobe of an Indian
    (<a href="#i_018"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 18</a>, <i>g</i>), are sometimes made of the skin of an
    otter, a beaver, a musk-rat, a weazel, a racoon, a pole-cat, a snake,
    a frog, a toad, a bat, a mouse, a mole, a hawk, an eagle, a magpie,
    or a sparrow:—sometimes of the skin of an animal so large as a wolf;
    and at others, of the skins of the lesser animals, so small that they
    are hidden under the dress, and very difficult to be found, even if
    searched for.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

  <p>Such then is the medicine-bag—such its meaning and importance; and when
    its owner dies, it is placed in his grave and decays with his body.</p>

  <p>In the case of the portrait of which I spoke in the beginning
    of this Letter, there are seen two medicine-bags in the hand of
    Pe-toh-pee-kiss; the one was of his own instituting, and the other was
    taken from his enemy, whom he had slain in battle; both of these he has
    a right to display and boast of on such an occasion. This is but the
    beginning or incipient stage of “medicines,” however, in this strange
    and superstitious country; and if you have patience, I will carry you
    a few degrees further into the mysteries of conjuration, before I
    close this Letter. Sit still then and read, until I relate a scene of
    a tragic, and yet of the most grotesque character, which took place in
    this Fort a few days since, and to all of which I was an eye-witness.
    The scene I will relate as it transpired precisely; and call it the
    story of the “doctor,” or the “Blackfoot medicine-man.”</p>

  <p>Not many weeks since, a party of Knisteneaux came here from the north,
    for the purpose of making their summer’s trade with the Fur Company;
    and, whilst here, a party of Blackfeet, their natural enemies (the
    same who are here now), came from the west, also to trade. These two
    belligerent tribes encamped on different sides of the Fort, and had
    spent some weeks here in the Fort and about it, in apparently good
    feeling and fellowship; unable in fact to act otherwise, for, according
    to a regulation of the Fort their arms and weapons were all locked up
    by M‘Kenzie in his “arsenal,” for the purpose of preserving the peace
    amongst these fighting-cocks.</p>

  <p>The Knisteneaux had completed their trade, and loitered about the
    premises, until all, both Indians and white men, were getting tired of
    their company, wishing them quietly off. When they were ready to start,
    with their goods packed upon their backs, their arms were given them,
    and they started; bidding everybody, both friends and foes, a hearty
    farewell. They went out of the Fort, and though the party gradually
    moved off, one of them undiscovered, loitered about the Fort, until he
    got an opportunity to poke the muzzle of his gun through between the
    piquets; when he fired it at one of the chiefs of the Blackfeet, who
    stood within a few paces, talking with Mr. M‘Kenzie, and shot him with
    two musket bullets through the centre of his body! The Blackfoot fell,
    and rolled about upon the ground in the agonies of death. The Blackfeet
    who were in the Fort seized their weapons and ran in a mass out of the
    Fort, in pursuit of the Knisteneaux, who were rapidly retreating to the
    bluffs. The Frenchmen in the Fort, also, at so flagrant and cowardly
    an insult, seized their guns and ran out, joining the Blackfeet in
    the pursuit. I, at that moment, ran to my painting-room in one of the
    bastions overlooking the plain, where I had a fair view of the affair;
    many shots were exchanged back and forward, and a skirmish ensued
    which lasted half an hour; the parties, however, were so far apart
    that little effect was produced; the Knisteneaux were driven off over
    the bluffs, having lost one man and had several others wounded. The
    Blackfeet and Frenchmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> returned into the Fort, and then, I saw what
    I never before saw in my life—I saw a “<em>medicine-man</em>” performing
    his mysteries over a dying man. The man who had been shot was still
    living, though two bullets had passed through the centre of his body,
    about two inches apart from each other; he was lying on the ground in
    the agonies of death, and no one could indulge the slightest hope of
    his recovery; yet the <em>medicine-man</em> must needs be called (for
    such a personage they had in their party), and hocus pocus applied to
    the dying man, as the dernier resort, when all drugs and all specifics
    were useless, and after all possibility of recovery was extinct!</p>

  <p>I have mentioned that all tribes have their physicians, who are also
    medicine (or mystery) men. These professional gentlemen are worthies
    of the highest order in all tribes. They are regularly called and paid
    as physicians, to prescribe for the sick; and many of them acquire
    great skill in the medicinal world, and gain much celebrity in their
    nation. Their first prescriptions are roots and herbs, of which they
    have a great variety of species; and when these have all failed, their
    last resort is to “<em>medicine</em>” or mystery; and for this purpose,
    each one of them has a strange and unaccountable dress, conjured up
    and constructed during a life-time of practice, in the wildest fancy
    imaginable, in which he arrays himself, and makes his last visit to
    his dying patient,—dancing over him, shaking his frightful rattles,
    and singing songs of incantation, in hopes to cure him by a charm.
    There are some instances, of course, where the exhausted patient
    unaccountably recovers, under the application of these absurd forms;
    and in such cases, this ingenious son of <em>Indian</em> Esculapius
    will be seen for several days after, on the top of a wigwam, with his
    right arm extended and waving over the gaping multitude, to whom he is
    vaunting forth, without modesty, the surprising skill he has acquired
    in his art, and the undoubted efficacy of his medicine or mystery. But
    if, on the contrary, the patient dies, he soon changes his dress, and
    joins in doleful lamentations with the mourners; and easily, with his
    craft, and the ignorance and superstition of his people, protects his
    reputation and maintains his influence over them; by assuring them,
    that it was the will of the Great Spirit that his patient should die,
    and when sent for, his feeble efforts must cease.</p>

  <p>Such was the case, and such the extraordinary means resorted to in
    the instance I am now relating. Several hundred spectators, including
    Indians and traders, were assembled around the dying man, when it was
    announced that the “<em>medicine-man</em>” was coming; we were required
    to “form a ring,” leaving a space of some thirty or forty feet in
    diameter around the dying man, in which the doctor could perform his
    wonderful operations; and a space was also opened to allow him free
    room to pass through the crowd without touching any one. This being
    done, in a few moments his arrival was announced by the death-like
    “hush——sh——” through the crowd; and nothing was to be heard, save the
    light and casual tinkling of the rattles upon his dress, which was
    scarcely perceptible to the ear, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> cautiously and slowly moved
    through the avenue left for him; which at length brought him into the
    ring, in view of the pitiable object over whom his mysteries were to be
    performed.</p>

  <p>Readers! you may have seen or read of the witch of Endor—or you may
    imagine all the ghosts, and spirits, and furies, that ever ranked
    amongst the “rank and file” of demonology; and yet you must see my
    painting of this strange scene before you can form a just conception
    of real frightful ugliness and Indian conjuration—yes, and even more:
    you must see the magic <em>dress</em> of this Indian “big bug” (which I
    have this day procured in all its parts), placed upon the back of some
    person who can imitate the strides, and swells, the grunts, and spring
    the rattles of an Indian magician.</p>

  <p>His entrée and his garb were somewhat thus:—he approached the ring
    with his body in a crouching position (<a href="#i_019"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 19</a>), with a slow
    and tilting step—his body and head were entirely covered with the skin
    of a yellow bear, the head of which (his own head being inside of it)
    served as a mask; the huge claws of which also, were dangling on his
    wrists and ancles; in one hand he shook a frightful rattle, and in the
    other brandished his medicine-spear or magic wand; to the rattling din
    and discord of all of which, he added the wild and startling jumps
    and yelps of the Indian, and the horrid and appalling grunts, and
    snarls, and growls of the grizzly bear, in ejaculatory and guttural
    incantations to the Good and Bad Spirits, in behalf of his patient; who
    was rolling and groaning in the agonies of death, whilst he was dancing
    around him, jumping over him, and pawing him about, and rolling him in
    every direction.</p>

  <p>In this wise, this strange operation proceeded for half an hour, to the
    surprise of a numerous and death-like silent audience, until the man
    died; and the medicine-man danced off to his quarters, and packed up,
    and tied and secured from the sight of the world, his mystery dress and
    equipments.</p>

  <p>This dress, in all its parts, is one of the greatest curiosities in the
    whole collection of Indian manufactures which I have yet obtained in
    the Indian country. It is the strangest medley and mixture, perhaps of
    the mysteries of the animal and vegetable kingdoms that ever was seen.
    Besides the skin of the yellow bear (which being almost an anomaly in
    that country, is out of the regular order of nature, and, of course,
    great medicine, and converted to a medicine use), there are attached to
    it the skins of many animals, which are also anomalies or deformities,
    which render them, in their estimation, <em>medicine</em>; and there are
    also the skins of snakes, and frogs, and bats,—beaks and toes and tails
    of birds,—hoofs of deer, goats, and antelopes; and, in fact, the “odds
    and ends,” and fag ends, and tails, and tips of almost everything that
    swims, flies, or runs, in this part of the wide world.</p>

  <p>Such is a medicine-man or a physician, and such is one of his wild
    and ridiculous manœuvres, which I have just witnessed in this strange
    country.</p>

  <p>These men, as I before remarked, are valued as dignitaries in the
    tribe, and the greatest respect is paid to them by the whole community;
    not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span> for their skill in their “materia medica;” but more
    especially for their tact in magic and mysteries, in which they all
    deal to a very great extent. I shall have much more to say of these
    characters and their doings in future epistles, and barely observe in
    the present place, that no tribe is without them;—that in all tribes
    their doctors are conjurors—are magicians—are sooth-sayers, and I had
    like to have said, high-priests, inasmuch as they superintend and
    conduct all their religious ceremonies;—they are looked upon by all
    as oracles of the nation. In all councils of war and peace, they have
    a seat with the chiefs—are regularly consulted before any public step
    is taken, and the greatest deference and respect is paid to their
    opinions.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MOUTH OF YELLOW STONE, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> Letter which I gave you yesterday, on the subject of “medicines”
    and “medicine-men,” has somewhat broken the “thread of my discourse;”
    and left my painting-room (in the bastion), and all the Indians in it,
    and portraits, and buffalo hunts, and landscapes of these beautiful
    regions, to be taken up and discussed; which I will now endeavour to
    do, beginning just where I left (or digressed) off.</p>

  <p>I was seated on the cool breech of a twelve-pounder, and had my easel
    before me, and Crows and Blackfeet, and Assinneboins, whom I was
    tracing upon the canvass. And so I have been doing to-day, and shall
    be for several days to come. My painting-room has become so great a
    lounge, and I so great a “medicine-man,” that all other amusements are
    left, and all other topics of conversation and gossip are postponed
    for future consideration. The chiefs have had to place “soldiers”
    (as they are called) at my door, with spears in hand to protect me
    from the throng, who otherwise would press upon me; and none but the
    worthies are allowed to come into my medicine apartments, and none to
    be painted, except such as are decided by the chiefs to be worthy of so
    high an honour.</p>

  <p>The Crows and Blackfeet who are here together, are enemies of the
    most deadly kind while out on the plains; but here they sit and smoke
    quietly together, yet with a studied and dignified reserve.</p>

  <p>The Blackfeet are, perhaps, one of the most (if not entirely the most)
    numerous and warlike tribes on the Continent. They occupy the whole of
    the country about the sources of the Missouri, from this place to the
    Rocky Mountains; and their numbers, from the best computations, are
    something like forty or fifty thousand—they are (like all other tribes
    whose numbers are sufficiently large to give them boldness) warlike
    and ferocious, <i>i. e.</i> they are predatory, are roaming fearlessly
    about the country, even into and through every part of the Rocky
    Mountains, and carrying war amongst their enemies, who are, of course,
    every tribe who inhabit the country about them.</p>

  <p>The Crows who live on the head waters of Yellow Stone, and extend from
    this neighbourhood also to the base of the Rocky Mountains, are similar
    in the above respects to the Blackfeet; roaming about a great part of
    the year—and seeking their enemies wherever they can find them.</p>

  <p>They are a much smaller tribe than the Blackfeet, with whom they are
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>always at war, and from whose great numbers they suffer prodigiously
    in battle; and probably will be in a few years entirely destroyed by
    them.</p>

  <p>The Crows have not, perhaps, more than 7000 in their nation, and
    probably not more than eight hundred warriors or fighting men. Amongst
    the more powerful tribes, like the Sioux and Blackfeet, who have been
    enabled to preserve their warriors, it is a fair calculation to count
    one in five as warriors; but among the Crows and Minatarees, and
    Puncahs, and several other small but warlike tribes, this proportion
    cannot exist; as in some of these I have found two or three women to
    a man in the nation; in consequence of the continual losses sustained
    amongst their men in war, and also whilst pursuing the buffaloes on the
    plains for food, where their lives are exceedingly exposed.</p>

  <p>The Blackfeet and the Crows, like the Sioux and Assinneboins, have
    nearly the same mode of constructing their wigwam or lodge; in which
    tribes it is made of buffalo skins sewed together, after being dressed,
    and made into the form of a tent; supported within by some twenty
    or thirty pine poles of twenty-five feet in height, with an apex or
    aperture at the top, through which the smoke escapes and the light
    is admitted. These lodges, or tents, are taken down in a few minutes
    by the squaws, when they wish to change their location, and easily
    transported to any part of the country where they wish to encamp;
    and they generally move some six or eight times in the course of the
    summer; following the immense herds of buffaloes, as they range over
    these vast plains, from east to west, and north to south. The objects
    for which they do this are two-fold,—to procure and dress their skins,
    which are brought in, in the fall and winter, and sold to the Fur
    Company, for white man’s luxury; and also for the purpose of killing
    and drying buffalo meat (<a href="#i_022"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 22</a>), which they bring in from
    their hunts, packed on their horses’ backs, in great quantities; making
    pemican, and preserving the marrow-fat for their winter quarters; which
    are generally taken up in some heavy-timbered bottom, on the banks of
    some stream, deep imbedded within the surrounding bluffs, which break
    off the winds, and make their long and tedious winter tolerable and
    supportable. They then sometimes erect their skin lodges amongst the
    timber, and dwell in them during the winter months; but more frequently
    cut logs and make a miserable and rude sort of log cabin, in which they
    can live much warmer and better protected from the assaults of their
    enemies, in case they are attacked; in which case a log cabin is a
    tolerable fort against Indian weapons.</p>

  <p>The Crows, of all the tribes in this region, or on the Continent, make
    the most beautiful lodge. As I have before mentioned, they construct
    them as the Sioux do, and make them of the same material; yet they
    oftentimes dress the skins of which they are composed almost as white
    as linen, and beautifully garnish them with porcupine quills, and
    paint and ornament them in such a variety of ways, as renders them
    exceedingly picturesque and agreeable to the eye. I have procured
    a very beautiful one of this description<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> (<a href="#i_020"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 20</a>),
    highly-ornamented, and fringed with scalp-locks, and sufficiently large
    for forty men to dine under. The poles which support it are about
    thirty in number, of pine, and all cut in the Rocky Mountains, having
    been some hundred years, perhaps, in use. This tent, when erected, is
    about twenty-five feet high, and has a very pleasing effect; with the
    Great or Good Spirit painted on one side, and the Evil Spirit on the
    other. If I can ever succeed in transporting it to New York and other
    eastern cities, it will be looked upon as a beautiful and exceedingly
    interesting specimen.</p>

  <p>The manner in which an encampment of Indians strike their tents and
    transport them is curious, and to the traveller in this country a very
    novel and unexpected sight, when he first beholds it. Whilst ascending
    the river to this place, I saw an encampment of Sioux, consisting of
    six hundred of these lodges, struck, and all things packed and on the
    move in a very few minutes. The chief sends his runners or criers (for
    such all chiefs keep in their employment) through the village, a few
    hours before they are to start; announcing his determination to move,
    and the hour fixed upon, and the necessary preparations are in the
    meantime making; and at the time announced, the lodge of the chief is
    seen flapping in the wind, a part of the poles having been taken out
    from under it; this is the signal, and in one minute, six hundred of
    them (on a level and beautiful prairie), which before had been strained
    tight and fixed, were seen waving and flapping in the wind, and in one
    minute more all were flat upon the ground. Their horses and dogs, of
    which they had a vast number, had all been secured upon the spot, in
    readiness; and each one was speedily loaded with the burthen allotted
    to it, and ready to fall into the grand procession.</p>

  <p>For this strange cavalcade, preparation is made in the following
    manner: the poles of a lodge are divided into two bunches, and the
    little ends of each bunch fastened upon the shoulders or withers of a
    horse, leaving the butt ends to drag behind on the ground on either
    side. Just behind the horse, a brace or pole is tied across, which
    keeps the poles in their respective places; and then upon that and
    the poles behind the horse, is placed the lodge or tent, which is
    rolled up, and also numerous other articles of household and domestic
    furniture, and on the top of all, two, three, and even (sometimes) four
    women and children! Each one of these horses has a conductress, who
    sometimes walks before and leads it, with a tremendous pack upon her
    own back; and at others she sits astride of its back, with a child,
    perhaps, at her breast, and another astride of the horse’s back behind
    her, clinging to her waist with one arm, while it affectionately
    embraces a sneaking dog-pup in the other.</p>

  <p>In this way five or six hundred wigwams, with all their furniture
    (<a href="#i_021"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 21</a>), may be seen drawn out for miles, creeping over the
    grass-covered plains of this country; and three times that number of
    men, on good horses, strolling along in front or on the flank; and, in
    some tribes, in the rear of this heterogeneous caravan, at least five
    times that number of dogs, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span> fall into the rank, and follow in
    the train and company of the women, and every cur of them, who is large
    enough, and not too cunning to be enslaved, is encumbered with a car or
    sled (or whatever it may be better called), on which he patiently drags
    his load—a part of the household goods and furniture of the lodge to
    which he belongs. Two poles, about fifteen feet long, are placed upon
    the dog’s shoulder, in the same manner as the lodge poles are attached
    to the horses, leaving the larger ends to drag upon the ground behind
    him; on which is placed a bundle or wallet which is allotted to him to
    carry, and with which he trots off amid the throng of dogs and squaws;
    faithfully and cheerfully dragging his load ’till night, and by the way
    loitering and occasionally</p>

  <p>The Crows, like the Blackfeet, are beautifully costumed, and perhaps
    with somewhat more of taste and elegance; inasmuch as the skins of
    which their dresses are made are more delicately and whitely dressed.
    The art of dressing skins belongs to the Indians in all countries;
    and the Crows surpass the civilized world in the beauty of their
    skin-dressing. The art of tanning is unknown to them, so far as
    civilized habits and arts have not been taught them; yet the art of
    dressing skins, so far as we have it in the civilized world, has been
    (like hundreds of other ornamental and useful customs which we are
    practising), borrowed from the savage; without our ever stopping to
    enquire from whence they come, or by whom invented.</p>

  <p>The usual mode of dressing the buffalo, and other skins, is by
    immersing them for a few days under a lye from ashes and water, until
    the hair can be removed; when they are strained upon a frame or upon
    the ground, with stakes or pins driven through the edges into the
    earth; where they remain for several days, with the brains of the
    buffalo or elk spread upon and over them; and at last finished by
    “graining,” as it is termed, by the squaws; who use a sharpened bone,
    the shoulder-blade or other large bone of the animal, sharpened at the
    edge, somewhat like an adze; with the edge of which they scrape the
    fleshy side of the skin; bearing on it with the weight of their bodies,
    thereby drying and softening the skin, and fitting it for use.</p>

  <p>The greater part of these skins, however, go through still another
    operation afterwards, which gives them a greater value, and renders
    them much more serviceable—that is, the process of smoking. For this,
    a small hole is dug in the ground, and a fire is built in it with
    rotten wood, which will produce a great quantity of smoke without
    much blaze; and several small poles of the proper length stuck in the
    ground around it, and drawn and fastened together at the top, around
    which a skin is wrapped in form of a tent, and generally sewed together
    at the edges to secure the smoke within it;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> within this the skins
    to be smoked are placed, and in this condition the tent will stand a
    day or so, enclosing the heated smoke; and by some chemical process
    or other, which I do not understand, the skins thus acquire a quality
    which enables them, after being ever so many times wet, to dry soft
    and pliant as they were before, which secret I have never yet seen
    practiced in my own country; and for the lack of which, all of our
    dressed skins when once wet, are, I think, chiefly ruined.</p>

  <p>An Indian’s dress of deer skins, which is wet a hundred times upon his
    back, dries soft; and his lodge also, which stands in the rains, and
    even through the severity of winter, is taken down as soft and as clean
    as when it was first put up.</p>

  <p>A Crow is known wherever he is met by his beautiful white dress, and
    his tall and elegant figure; the greater part of the men being six
    feet high. The Blackfeet on the other hand, are more of the Herculean
    make—about middling stature, with broad shoulders, and great expansion
    of chest; and the skins of which their dresses are made, are chiefly
    dressed black, or of a dark brown colour; from which circumstance, in
    all probability, they having black leggings or moccasins, have got the
    name of Blackfeet.</p>

  <p>The Crows are very handsome and gentlemanly Indians in their personal
    appearance: and have been always reputed, since the first acquaintance
    made with them, very civil and friendly.</p>

  <p>These people to be sure, have in some instances plundered and robbed
    trappers and travellers in their country; and for that I have sometimes
    heard them called rascals and thieves, and rogues of the first order,
    &amp;c.; yet they do not consider themselves such; for thieving in their
    estimation is a high crime, and considered the most disgraceful act
    that a man can possibly do. They call this <em>capturing</em>, where
    they sometimes run off a Trader’s horses, and make their boast of it;
    considering it a kind of retaliation or summary justice, which they
    think it right and honourable that they should administer. And why
    not? for the unlicensed trespass committed through their country from
    one end to the other, by mercenary white men, who are destroying the
    game, and catching all the beaver and other rich and valuable furs
    out of their country, without paying them an equivalent, or, in fact,
    anything at all, for it; and this too, when they have been warned time
    and again of the danger they would be in, if they longer persisted in
    the practice. Reader, I look upon the Indian as the most honest and
    honourable race of people that I ever lived amongst in my life; and in
    their native state, I pledge you my honour they are the last of all
    the human family to pilfer or to steal, if you trust to their honour;
    and for this never-ending and boundless system of theft and plunder,
    and debauchery, that is practiced off upon these rightful owners of
    the soil, by acquisitive white men, I consider the infliction, or
    retaliation, by driving off and appropriating a few horses, but a
    lenient punishment, which those persons at least should expect; and
    which, in fact, none but a very honourable and high-minded people
    could inflict, instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span> of a much severer one; which they could easily
    practice upon the few white men in their country, without rendering
    themselves amenable to any law.</p>

  <p>Mr. M‘Kenzie has repeatedly told me, within the four last weeks, while
    in conversation relative to the Crows, that they were friendly and
    honourable in their dealing with the whites, and that he considered
    them the finest Indians of his acquaintance.</p>

  <p>I recollect whilst in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, and other places at the East, to have
    heard it often said, that the Crows were a rascally and thieving set of
    vagabonds, highway robbers, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and I have been told since, that
    this information has become current in the world, from the fact that
    they made some depredations upon the camp of Messrs. Crooks and Hunt of
    the Fur Company; and drove off a number of their horses, when they were
    passing through the Crow country, on their way to Astoria. This was no
    doubt true; and equally true, would these very Indians tell us, was the
    fact, that they had a good and sufficient reason for it.</p>

  <p>These gentlemen, with their party, were crossing the Crow country
    with a large stock of goods, of guns, and ammunition, of knives, and
    spears, arrowheads, &amp;c.; and stopped for some time and encamped in the
    midst of the Crow country (and I think wintered there), when the Crows
    assembled in large numbers about them, and treated them in a kind and
    friendly manner; and at the same time proposed to trade with them for
    guns and ammunition, &amp;c. (according to these gentlemen’s own account,)
    of which they were in great want, and for which they brought a great
    many horses, and offered them repeatedly in trade; which they refused
    to take, persisting in their determination of carrying their goods
    to their destined place, across the mountains; thereby disappointing
    these Indians, by denying them the arms and weapons which were in
    their possession, whilst they were living upon them, and exhausting
    the game and food of their country. No doubt, these gentlemen told the
    Crows, that these goods were going to Astoria, of which place they knew
    nothing; and of course, it was enough for them that they were going to
    take them farther west; which they would at once suppose was to the
    Blackfeet, their principal enemy, having eight or ten warriors to one
    of the Crows; where they supposed the white men could get a greater
    price for their weapons, and arm their enemies in such a way as would
    enable them to turn upon the Crows, and cut them to pieces without
    mercy. Under these circumstances, the Crows rode off, and to show their
    indignation, drove off some of the Company’s horses, for which they
    have ever since been denominated a band of thieves and highway robbers.
    It is a custom, and a part of the system of jurisprudence amongst all
    savages, to revenge upon the person or persons who give the offence,
    if they can; and if not, to let that punishment fall upon the head of
    the first white man who comes in their way, provided the offender was a
    white man. And I would not be surprised, therefore, if I get robbed of
    my horse; and you too, readers, if you go into that country, for that
    very (supposed) offence.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

  <p>I have conversed often and much with Messrs. Sublette and Campbell,
    two gentlemen of the highest respectability, who have traded with the
    Crows for several years, and they tell me they are one of the most
    honourable, honest, and high-minded races of people on earth; and with
    Mr. Tullock, also, a man of the strictest veracity, who is now here
    with a party of them; and, he says, they never steal,—have a high
    sense of honour,—and being fearless and proud, are quick to punish or
    retaliate.</p>

  <p>So much for the character of the Crows for the present, a subject which
    I shall assuredly take up again, when I shall have seen more of them
    myself.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MOUTH OF YELLOW STONE, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Since</span> my last Letter, nothing of great moment has transpired at this
    place; but I have been continually employed in painting my portraits
    and making notes on the character and customs of the wild folks who
    are about me. I have just been painting a number of the Crows, fine
    looking and noble gentlemen. They are really a handsome and well-formed
    set of men as can be seen in any part of the world. There is a sort of
    ease and grace added to their dignity of manners, which gives them the
    air of gentlemen at once. I observed the other day, that most of them
    were over six feet high, and very many of these have cultivated their
    natural hair to such an almost incredible length, that it sweeps the
    ground as they walk; there are frequent instances of this kind amongst
    them, and in some cases, a foot or more of it will drag on the grass
    as they walk, giving exceeding grace and beauty to their movements.
    They usually oil their hair with a profusion of bear’s grease every
    morning, which is no doubt one cause of the unusual length to which
    their hair extends; though it cannot be the sole cause of it, for the
    other tribes throughout this country use the bear’s grease in equal
    profusion without producing the same results. The Mandans, however, and
    the Sioux, of whom I shall speak in future epistles, have cultivated
    a very great growth of the hair, as many of them are seen whose hair
    reaches near to the ground.</p>

  <p>This extraordinary length of hair amongst the Crows is confined to the
    men alone; for the women, though all of them with glossy and beautiful
    hair, and a great profusion of it, are unable to cultivate it to so
    great a length; or else they are not allowed to compete with their
    lords in a fashion so ornamental (and on which the men so highly pride
    themselves), and are obliged in many cases to cut it short off.</p>

  <p>The fashion of long hair amongst the men, prevails throughout all the
    Western and North Western tribes, after passing the Sacs and Foxes; and
    the Pawnees of the Platte, who, with two or three other tribes only,
    are in the habit of shaving nearly the whole head.</p>

  <p>The present chief of the Crows, who is called “Long-hair,” and has
    received his name as well as his office from the circumstance of
    having the longest hair of any man in the nation, I have not yet
    seen: but I hope I yet may, ere I leave this part of the country.
    This extraordinary man is known to several gentlemen with whom I am
    acquainted, and particularly to Messrs. Sublette and Campbell, of whom
    I have before spoken, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> told me they had lived in his hospitable
    lodge for months together; and assured me that they had measured his
    hair by a correct means, and found it to be ten feet and seven inches
    in length; closely inspecting every part of it at the same time, and
    satisfying themselves that it was the natural growth.</p>

  <p>On ordinary occasions it is wound with a broad leather strap, from his
    head to its extreme end, and then folded up into a budget or block, of
    some ten or twelve inches in length, and of some pounds weight; which
    when he walks is carried under his arm, or placed in his bosom, within
    the folds of his robe; but on any great parade or similar occasion, his
    pride is to unfold it, oil it with bear’s grease and let it drag behind
    him, some three or four feet of it spread out upon the grass, and black
    and shining like a raven’s wing.</p>

  <p>It is a common custom amongst most of these upper tribes, to splice or
    add on several lengths of hair, by fastening them with glue; probably
    for the purpose of imitating the Crows, upon whom alone Nature has
    bestowed this conspicuous and signal ornament.</p>

  <p>Amongst the Crows of distinction now at this place, I have painted
    the portraits of several, who exhibit some striking peculiarities.
    Amongst whom is Chah-ee-chopes, the four wolves (<a href="#i_024"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 24</a>);
    a fine looking fellow, six feet in stature, and whose natural hair
    sweeps the grass as he walks; he is beautifully clad, and carries
    himself with the most graceful and manly mien—he is in mourning for
    a brother; and according to their custom, has cut off a number of
    locks of his long hair, which is as much as a man can well spare of
    so valued an ornament, which he has been for the greater part of his
    life cultivating; whilst a woman who mourns for a husband or child, is
    obliged to crop her hair short to her head, and so remain till it grows
    out again; ceasing gradually to mourn as her hair approaches to its
    former length.</p>

  <p>Duhk-pits-a-ho-shee, the red bear (<a href="#i_026"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 26</a>), a distinguished
    warrior; and Oo-je-en-a-he-ha, the woman who lives in the bear’s den
    (<a href="#i_024"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 25</a>). I have also painted Pa-ris-ka-roo-pa (two crows)
    the younger (<a href="#i_026"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 27</a>), one of the most extraordinary men in
    the Crow nation; not only for his looks, from the form of his head,
    which seems to be distortion itself—and curtailed of all its fair
    proportions; but from his extraordinary sagacity as a counsellor and
    orator, even at an early stage of his life.</p>

  <p>There is something very uncommon in this outline, and sets forth the
    striking peculiarity of the Crow tribe, though rather in an exaggerated
    form. The semi-lunar outline of the Crow head, with an exceedingly low
    and retreating forehead, is certainly a very peculiar and striking
    characteristic; and though not so strongly marked in most of the tribe
    as in the present instance, is sufficient for their detection whenever
    they are met; and will be subject for further comment in another place.</p>

  <p>The Crow women (and Blackfeet also) are not handsome, and I shall at
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>present say but little of them. They are, like all other Indian
    women, the slaves of their husbands: being obliged to perform all the
    domestic duties and drudgeries of the tribe, and not allowed to join
    in their religious rites or ceremonies, nor in the dance or other
    amusements.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="col50">26</span><span class="col50">27</span></figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The women in all these upper and western tribes are decently dressed,
    and many of them with great beauty and taste; their dresses are all of
    deer or goat skins, extending from their chins quite down to the feet;
    these dresses are in many instances trimmed with ermine, and ornamented
    with porcupine quills and beads with exceeding ingenuity.</p>

  <p>The Crow and Blackfeet women, like all others I ever saw in any Indian
    tribe, divide the hair on the forehead, and paint the separation or
    crease with vermilion or red earth. For what purpose this little, but
    universal, custom is observed, I never have been able to learn.</p>

  <p>The men amongst the Blackfeet tribe, have a fashion equally simple, and
    probably of as little meaning, which seems strictly to be adhered to
    by every man in the tribe; they separate the hair in two places on the
    forehead, leaving a lock between the two, of an inch or two in width,
    which is carefully straightened down on to the bridge of the nose, and
    there cut square off. It is more than probable that this is done for
    the purpose of distinction; that they may thereby be free from the
    epithet of effeminacy, which might otherwise attach to them.</p>

  <p>These two tribes, whom I have spoken of connectedly, speak two distinct
    and entirely dissimilar languages; and the language of each is
    different, and radically so, from that of all other tribes about them.
    As these people are always at war, and have been, time out of mind,
    they do not intermarry or hold converse with each other, by which any
    knowledge of each other’s language could be acquired. It would be the
    work of a man’s life-time to collect the languages of all the different
    tribes which I am visiting; and I shall, from necessity, leave this
    subject chiefly for others, who have the time to devote to them, to
    explain them to the world. I have, however, procured a brief vocabulary
    of their words and sentences in these tribes; and shall continue to do
    so amongst the tribes I shall visit, which will answer as a specimen
    or sample in each; and which, in the sequel to these Letters (if they
    should ever be published), will probably be arranged.</p>

  <p>The Blackfeet are, perhaps, the most powerful tribe of Indians on
    the Continent; and being sensible of their strength, have stubbornly
    resisted the Traders in their country, who have been gradually forming
    an acquaintance with them, and endeavouring to establish a permanent
    and profitable system of trade. Their country abounds in beaver and
    buffalo, and most of the fur-bearing animals of North America; and
    the American Fur Company, with an unconquerable spirit of trade and
    enterprize, has pushed its establishments into their country; and the
    numerous parties of trappers are tracing up their streams and rivers,
    rapidly destroying the beavers which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> dwell in them. The Blackfeet
    have repeatedly informed the Traders of the Company, that if their
    men persisted in trapping beavers in their country, they should kill
    them whenever they met them. They have executed their threats in many
    instances, and the Company loses some fifteen or twenty men annually,
    who fall by the hands of these people, in defence of what they deem
    their property and their rights. Trinkets and whiskey, however, will
    soon spread their charms amongst these, as they have amongst other
    tribes; and white man’s voracity will sweep the prairies and the
    streams of their wealth, to the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean;
    leaving the Indians to inhabit, and at last to starve upon, a dreary
    and solitary waste.</p>

  <p>The Blackfeet, therefore, having been less traded with, and less seen
    by white people than most of the other tribes, are more imperfectly
    understood; and it yet remains a question to be solved—whether there
    are twenty, or forty or fifty thousand of them? for no one, as yet, can
    correctly estimate their real strength. From all I can learn, however,
    which is the best information that can be got from the Traders, there
    are not far from 40,000 Indians (altogether), who range under the
    general denomination of Blackfeet.</p>

  <p>From our slight and imperfect knowledge of them, and other tribes
    occupying the country about the sources of the Missouri, there is no
    doubt in my mind, that we are in the habit of bringing more Indians
    into the computation, than are entitled justly to the appellation of
    “Blackfeet.”</p>

  <p>Such, for instance, are the “Grosventres de Prairie” and Cotonnés,
    neither of which speak the Blackfeet language; but hunt, and eat,
    and fight, and intermarry with the Blackfeet; living therefore in a
    state of confederacy and friendship with them, but speaking their own
    language, and practicing their own customs.</p>

  <p>The Blackfeet proper are divided into four bands or families, as
    follow:—the “Pe-a-gans,” of 500 lodges; the “Blackfoot” band, of 450
    lodges; the “Blood” band, of 450 lodges; and the “Small Robes,” of 250
    lodges. These four bands constituting about 1650 lodges, averaging ten
    to the lodge, amount to about 16,500 souls.</p>

  <p>There are then of the other tribes above-mentioned (and whom we,
    perhaps, incorrectly denominate Blackfeet), Grosventres des Prairies,
    430 lodges, with language entirely distinct; Circees, of 220 lodges,
    and Cotonnés, of 250 lodges, with language also distinct from either.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

  <p>There is in this region a rich and interesting field for the linguist
    of the antiquarian; and stubborn facts, I think, if they could be well
    procured, that would do away the idea which many learned gentlemen
    entertain, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
    Indian languages of North America can all be traced to two or three
    roots. The language of the Dohcotas is entirely and radically distinct
    from that of the Mandans, and theirs equally so from the Blackfoot and
    the Crows. And from the lips of Mr. Brazeau, a gentleman of education
    and strict observation, who has lived several years with the Blackfeet
    and Shiennes, and who speaks the language of tribes on either side
    of them, assures me that these languages are radically distinct and
    dissimilar, as I have above stated; and also, that although he has
    been several years amongst those tribes, he has not been able to trace
    the slightest resemblance between the Circee, Cotonné, and Blackfoot,
    and Shienne, and Crow, and Mandan tongues; and from a great deal
    of corroborating information, which I have got from other persons
    acquainted with these tribes, I am fully convinced of the correctness
    of his statements.</p>

  <p>Besides the Blackfeet and Crows, whom I told you were assembled at
    this place, are also the Knisteneaux (or Crees, as they are commonly
    called), a very pretty and pleasing tribe of Indians, of about 3000
    in number, living on the north of this, and also the Assinneboins and
    Ojibbeways; both of which tribes also inhabit the country to the north
    and north-east of the mouth of Yellow Stone.</p>

  <p>The Knisteneaux are of small stature, but well-built for strength and
    activity combined; are a people of wonderful prowess for their numbers,
    and have waged an unceasing warfare with the Blackfeet, who are their
    neighbours and enemies on the west. From their disparity in numbers
    they are rapidly thinning the ranks of their warriors, who bravely
    sacrifice their lives in contentions with their powerful neighbours.
    This tribe occupy the country from the mouth of the Yellow Stone, in
    a north-western direction, far into the British territory, and trade
    principally at the British N. W. Company’s Posts.</p>

  <p>The Assinneboins of seven thousand, and the Ojibbeways of six thousand,
    occupy a vast extent of country, in a north-eastern direction from
    this; extending also into the British possessions as high north as
    Lake Winnepeg; and trading principally with the British Company. These
    three tribes are in a state of nature, living as neighbours, and are
    also on terms of friendship with each other. This friendship, however,
    is probably but a temporary arrangement, brought about by the Traders
    amongst them; and which, like most Indian peace establishments, will be
    of short duration.</p>

  <p>The Ojibbeways are, undoubtedly, a part of the tribe of Chippeways,
    with whom we are more familiarly acquainted, and who inhabit the
    south-west shore of Lake Superior. Their language is the same, though
    they are separated several hundred miles from any of them, and seem to
    have no knowledge of them, or traditions of the manner in which, or of
    the time when, they became severed from each other.</p>

  <p>The Assinneboins are a part of the Dohcotas, or Sioux, undoubtedly; for
    their personal appearance as well as their language is very similar.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

  <p>At what time, or in what manner, these two parts of a nation got
    strayed away from each other is a mystery; yet such cases have often
    occurred, of which I shall say more in future. Large parties who
    are straying off in pursuit of game, or in the occupation of war,
    are oftentimes intercepted by their enemy; and being prevented from
    returning, are run off to a distant region, where they take up their
    residence and establish themselves as a nation.</p>

  <p>There is a very curious custom amongst the Assinneboins, from which
    they have taken their name; a name given them by their neighbours,
    from a singular mode they have of boiling their meat, which is done in
    the following manner:—when they kill meat, a hole is dug in the ground
    about the size of a common pot, and a piece of the raw hide of the
    animal, as taken from the back, is put over the hole, and then pressed
    down with the hands close around the sides, and filled with water. The
    meat to be boiled is then put in this hole or pot of water; and in a
    fire, which is built near by, several large stones are heated to a red
    heat, which are successively dipped and held in the water until the
    meat is boiled; from which singular and peculiar custom, the Ojibbeways
    have given them the appellation of Assinneboins or stone boilers.</p>

  <p>This custom is a very awkward and tedious one, and used only as an
    ingenious means of boiling their meat, by a tribe who was too rude and
    ignorant to construct a kettle or pot.</p>

  <p>The Traders have recently supplied these people with pots; and even
    long before that, the Mandans had instructed them in the secret of
    manufacturing very good and serviceable earthen pots; which together
    have entirely done away the custom, excepting at public festivals;
    where they seem, like all others of the human family, to take pleasure
    in cherishing and perpetuating their ancient customs.</p>

  <p>Of these three tribes, I have also lined my painting-room with a number
    of very interesting portraits of the distinguished and brave men; and
    also representations of their games and ceremonies, which will be found
    in my <span class="smcap">Indian Gallery</span>, if I live, and they can be preserved
    until I get home.</p>

  <p>The Assinneboins, or stone boilers, are a fine and noble looking race
    of Indians; bearing, both in their looks and customs, a striking
    resemblance to the Dohcotas or Sioux, from whom they have undoubtedly
    sprung. The men are tall, and graceful in their movements; and wear
    their pictured robes of the buffalo hide with great skill and pleasing
    effect. They are good hunters, and tolerably supplied with horses;
    and living in a country abounding with buffaloes, are well supplied
    with the necessaries of Indian life, and may be said to live well.
    Their games and amusements are many, of which the most valued one is
    the ball-play; and in addition to which, they have the game of the
    moccasin, horse-racing, and dancing; some one of which, they seem to be
    almost continually practicing, and of all of which I shall hereafter
    give the reader (as well as of many others of their amusements) a
    minute account.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

  <p>Their dances, which were frequent and varied, were generally exactly
    the same as those of the Sioux, of which I have given a faithful
    account in my Notes on the Sioux, and which the reader will soon meet
    with. There was one of these scenes, however, that I witnessed the
    other day, which appeared to me to be peculiar to this tribe, and
    exceedingly picturesque in its effect; which was described to me as
    the <em>pipe-dance</em>, and was as follows:—On a hard-trodden pavement
    in front of their village, which place is used for all their public
    meetings, and many of their amusements, the young men, who were
    to compose the dance, had gathered themselves around a small fire
    (<a href="#i_032"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 32</a>), and each one seated on a buffalo-robe spread upon
    the ground. In the centre and by the fire, was seated a dignitary, who
    seemed to be a chief (perhaps a doctor or medicine-man), with a long
    pipe in his hand, which he lighted at the fire and smoked incessantly,
    grunting forth at the same time, in half-strangled gutturals, a sort
    of song, which I did not get translated to my satisfaction, and which
    might have been susceptible of none. While this was going on, another
    grim-visaged fellow in another part of the group, commenced beating
    on a drum or tambourine, accompanied by his voice; when one of the
    young men seated, sprang instantly on his feet, and commenced singing
    in time with the taps of the drum, and leaping about on one foot and
    the other in the most violent manner imaginable. In this way he went
    several times around the circle, bowing and brandishing his fists in
    the faces of each one who was seated, until at length he grasped one of
    them by the hands, and jerked him forcibly up upon his feet; who joined
    in the dance for a moment, leaving the one who had pulled him up, to
    continue his steps and his song in the centre of the ring; whilst he
    danced around in a similar manner, jerking up another, and then joining
    his companion in the centre; leaving the third and the fourth, and
    so on to drag into the ring, each one his man, until all were upon
    their feet; and at last joined in the most frightful gesticulations
    and yells that seemed almost to make the earth quake under our feet.
    This strange manœuvre, which I did but partially understand, lasted
    for half or three-quarters of an hour; to the great amusement of the
    gaping multitude who were assembled around, and broke up with the most
    piercing yells and barks like those of so many affrighted dogs.</p>

  <p>The Assinneboins, somewhat like the Crows, cultivate their hair to
    a very great length, in many instances reaching down nearly to the
    ground; but in most instances of this kind, I find the great length is
    produced by splicing or adding on several lengths, which are fastened
    very ingeniously by means of glue, and the joints obscured by a sort
    of paste of red earth and glue, with which the hair is at intervals of
    every two or three inches filled, and divided into locks and slabs of
    an inch or so in breadth, and falling straight down over the back to
    the heels.</p>

  <p>I have painted the portrait of a very distinguished young man, and son
    of the chief (<a href="#i_028"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 28</a>); his dress is a very handsome one, and
    in every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> respect answers well to the descriptions I have given above.
    The name of this man is Wi-jun-jon (the pigeon’s egg head), and by the
    side of him (<a href="#i_028"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 29</a>) will be seen the portrait of his wife,
    Chin-cha-pee (the fire bug that creeps), a fine looking squaw, in a
    handsome dress of the mountain-sheep skin, holding in her hand a stick
    curiously carved, with which every woman in this country is supplied;
    for the purpose of digging up the “Pomme Blanche,” or prairie turnip,
    which is found in great quantities in these northern prairies, and
    furnishes the Indians with an abundant and nourishing food. The women
    collect these turnips by striking the end of the stick into the ground,
    and prying them out; after which they are dried and preserved in their
    wigwams for use during the season.</p>

  <p>I have just had the satisfaction of seeing this travelled-gentleman
    (Wi-jun-jon) meet his tribe, his wife and his little children; after an
    absence of a year or more, on his journey of 6000 miles to Washington
    City, and back again (in company with Major Sanford, the Indian agent);
    where he has been spending the winter amongst the fashionables in the
    polished circles of civilized society. And I can assure you, readers,
    that his entrée amongst his own people, in the dress and with the airs
    of a civilized beau, was one of no ordinary occurrence; and produced no
    common sensation amongst the red-visaged Assinneboins, or in the minds
    of those who were travellers, and but spectators to the scene.</p>

  <p>On his way home from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis to this place, a distance of 2000 miles,
    I travelled with this gentleman, on the steamer Yellow-Stone; and saw
    him step ashore (on a beautiful prairie, where several thousands of
    his people were encamped), with a complete suit <i lang="fr">en militaire</i>,
    a colonel’s uniform of blue, presented to him by the President of
    the United States, with a beaver hat and feather, with epaulettes of
    gold—with sash and belt, and broad sword; with high-heeled boots—with
    a keg of whiskey under his arm, and a blue umbrella in his hand. In
    this plight and metamorphose, he took his position on the bank, amongst
    his friends—his wife and other relations; not one of whom exhibited,
    for an half-hour or more, the least symptoms of recognition, although
    they knew well who was before them. He also gazed upon them—upon his
    wife and parents, and little children, who were about, as if they were
    foreign to him, and he had not a feeling or thought to interchange with
    them. Thus the mutual gazings upon and from this would-be-stranger,
    lasted for full half an hour; when a gradual, but cold and exceedingly
    formal recognition began to take place, and an acquaintance ensued,
    which ultimately and smoothly resolved itself, without the least
    apparent emotion, into its former state; and the mutual kindred
    intercourse seemed to flow on exactly where it had been broken off,
    as if it had been but for a moment, and nothing had transpired in the
    interim to check or change its character or expression.</p>

  <p>Such is one of the stoic instances of a custom which belongs to all the
    North American Indians, forming one of the most striking features in
    their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span> character; valued, cherished and practiced, like many others
    of their strange notions, for reasons which are difficult to be learned
    or understood; and which probably will never be justly appreciated by
    others than themselves.</p>

  <p>This man, at this time, is creating a wonderful sensation amongst
    his tribe, who are daily and nightly gathered in gaping and listless
    crowds around him, whilst he is descanting upon what he has seen in the
    fashionable world; and which to them is unintelligible and beyond their
    comprehension; for which I find they are already setting him down as a
    liar and impostor.</p>

  <p>What may be the final results of his travels and initiation into the
    fashionable world, and to what disasters his incredible narrations
    may yet subject the poor fellow in this strange land, time only will
    develop.</p>

  <p>He is now in disgrace, and spurned by the leading men of the tribe, and
    rather to be pitied than envied, for the advantages which one might
    have supposed would have flown from his fashionable tour. More of this
    curious occurrence and of this extraordinary man, I will surely give in
    some future epistles.</p>

  <p>The women of this tribe are often comely, and sometimes pretty; in
    <a href="#i_034"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 34</a>, will be seen a fair illustration of the dresses of
    the women and children, which are usually made of the skins of the
    mountain-goat, and ornamented with porcupine’s quills and rows of elk’s
    teeth.</p>

  <p>The Knisteneaux (or Crees, as they are more familiarly called in this
    country) are a very numerous tribe, extending from this place as high
    north as the shores of Lake Winnepeg; and even much further in a
    north-westerly direction, towards, and even through, a great part of
    the Rocky Mountains.</p>

  <p>I have before said of these, that they were about 3000 in numbers—by
    that, I meant but a small part of this extensive tribe, who are in the
    habit of visiting the American Fur Company’s Establishment, at this
    place, to do their trading; and who themselves, scarcely know anything
    of the great extent of country over which this numerous and scattered
    family range. Their customs may properly be said to be primitive, as no
    inroads of civilized habits have been as yet successfully made amongst
    them. Like the other tribes in these regions, they dress in skins, and
    gain their food, and conduct their wars in a very similar manner. They
    are a very daring and most adventurous tribe; roaming vast distances
    over the prairies and carrying war into their enemy’s country. With the
    numerous tribe of Blackfeet, they are always waging an uncompromising
    warfare; and though fewer in numbers and less in stature, they have
    shewn themselves equal in sinew, and not less successful in mortal
    combats.</p>

  <p>Amongst the foremost and most renowned of their warriors, is
    Bro-cas-sie, the broken arm (<a href="#i_030"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 30</a>), in a handsome dress;
    and by the side of him (<a href="#i_030"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 31</a>), his wife, a simple and
    comely looking woman. In <a href="#i_033"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 33</a>, will be seen the full
    length portrait of a young woman with a child on her back, shewing
    fairly the fashion of cutting and ornamenting the dresses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> of the
    females in this tribe; which, without further comment, is all I shall
    say at this time, of the valorous tribe of Crees or Knisteneaux.</p>

  <p>The Ojibbeways I have briefly mentioned in a former place, and of them
    should say more; which will be done at a proper time, after I shall
    have visited other branches of this great and scattered family.</p>

  <p>The chief of that part of the Ojibbeway tribe who inhabit these
    northern regions (<a href="#i_035"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 35</a>), and whose name is Sha-co-pay (the
    Six), is a man of huge size; with dignity of manner, and pride and
    vanity, just about in proportion to his bulk. He sat for his portrait
    in a most beautiful dress, fringed with scalp locks in profusion; which
    he had snatched, in his early life from his enemies’ heads, and now
    wears as proud trophies and proofs of what his arm has accomplished
    in battles with his enemies. His shirt of buckskin is beautifully
    embroidered and painted in curious hieroglyphics, the history of his
    battles and charts of his life. This, and also each and every article
    of his varied dress, had been manufactured by his wives, of which
    he had several; and one, though not the most agreeable (<a href="#i_036"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    36</a>), is seen represented by his side.</p>

  <p>I have much to see of these people yet, and much consequently to write;
    so for the present I close my book.</p>

        and is at this time superintendent of Indian affairs at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis), who
        informed me, much to my surprise, that the Blackfeet were not far from

  <div class="subheadc">MOUTH OF YELLOW STONE, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the dates of my other Letters from this place, I have been taking
    some wild rambles about this beautiful country of green fields; jolted
    and tossed about, on horseback and on foot, where pen, ink, and paper
    never thought of going; and of course the most that I saw and have
    learned, and would tell to the world, is yet to be written. It is not
    probable, however, that I shall again date a letter at this place, as I
    commence, in a few days, my voyage down the river in a canoe; but yet
    I may give you many a retrospective glance at this fairy land and its
    amusements.</p>

  <p>A traveller on his tour through such a country as this, has no time
    to write, and scarcely time enough to moralize. It is as much as
    he can <em>well</em> do to “look out for his <em>scalp</em>,” and “for
    <em>something to eat</em>.” Impressions, however, of the most vivid kind,
    are rapidly and indelibly made by the fleeting incidents of savage
    life; and for the mind that can ruminate upon them with pleasure, there
    are abundant materials clinging to it for its endless entertainment
    in driving the quill when he gets back. The mind susceptible of such
    impressions catches volumes of incidents which are easy to write—it is
    but to unfold a web which the fascinations of this <em>shorn</em> country
    and its allurements have spun over the soul—it is but to paint the
    splendid panorama of a world entirely different from anything seen or
    painted before; with its thousands of miles, and tens of thousands of
    grassy hills and dales, where nought but silence reigns, and where the
    soul of a contemplative mould is seemingly lifted up to its Creator.
    What man in the world, I would ask, ever ascended to the pinnacle of
    one of Missouri’s green-carpeted bluffs, a thousand miles severed from
    his own familiar land, and giddily gazed over the interminable and
    boundless ocean of grass-covered hills and valleys which lie beneath
    him, where the gloom of <em>silence</em> is complete—where not even
    the voice of the sparrow or cricket is heard—without feeling a sweet
    melancholy come over him, which seemed to drown his sense of everything
    beneath and on a level with him?</p>

  <p>It is but to paint a vast country of green fields, where the <em>men</em>
    are all <em>red</em>—where <em>meat</em> is the staff of life—where
    no <em>laws</em>, but those of <em>honour</em>, are known—where the
    oak and the pine give way to the cotton-wood and peccan—where the
    buffaloes range, the elk, mountain-sheep, and the fleet-bounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
    antelope—where the magpie and chattering parroquettes supply the
    place of the red-breast and the blue-bird—where wolves are white and
    bears grizzly—where pheasants are hens of the prairie, and frogs have
    horns!—where the rivers are yellow, and white men are turned savages
    in looks. Through the whole of this strange land the dogs are all
    wolves—women all slaves—men all lords. The <em>sun</em> and <em>rats</em>
    alone (of all the list of old acquaintance), could be recognised in
    this country of strange metamorphose. The former shed everywhere his
    familiar rays; and Monsr. Ratapon was hailed as an old acquaintance,
    which it gave me pleasure to meet; though he had grown a little more
    <em>savage</em> in his look.</p>

  <p>In traversing the immense regions of the <em>classic</em> West, the mind
    of a philanthropist is filled to the brim with feelings of admiration;
    but to reach this country, one is obliged to descend from the light
    and glow of civilized atmosphere, through the different grades of
    civilization, which gradually sink to the most deplorable condition
    along the extreme frontier; thence through the most pitiable misery
    and wretchedness of savage degradation; where the genius of natural
    liberty and independence have been blasted and destroyed by the
    contaminating vices and dissipations introduced by the immoral part
    of <em>civilized</em> society. Through this dark and sunken vale of
    wretchedness one hurries, as through a pestilence, until he gradually
    rises again into the proud and chivalrous pale of savage society,
    in its state of original nature, beyond the reach of civilized
    contamination; here he finds much to fix his enthusiasm upon, and much
    to admire. Even here, the predominant passions of the savage breast,
    of ferocity and cruelty, are often found; yet <em>restrained</em>,
    and frequently <em>subdued</em>, by the noblest traits, of honour and
    magnanimity,—a race of men who live and enjoy life and its luxuries,
    and practice its virtues, very far beyond the usual estimation of the
    world, who are apt to judge the savage and his virtues from the poor,
    degraded, and humbled specimens which alone can be seen along our
    frontiers. From the first settlements of our Atlantic coast to the
    present day, the bane of this <em>blasting frontier</em> has regularly
    crowded upon them, from the northern to the southern extremities of our
    country; and, like the fire in a prairie, which destroys everything
    where it passes, it has blasted and sunk them, and all but their
    names, into oblivion, wherever it has travelled. It is to this tainted
    class alone that the epithet of “poor, naked, and drunken savage,”
    can be, with propriety, applied; for all those numerous tribes which
    I have visited, and are yet uncorrupted by the vices of civilized
    acquaintance, are well clad, in many instances cleanly, and in the
    full enjoyment of life and its luxuries. It is for the character and
    preservation of these noble fellows that I am an enthusiast; and it is
    for these uncontaminated people that I would be willing to devote the
    energies of my life. It is a sad and melancholy truth to contemplate,
    that all the numerous tribes who inhabited our vast Atlantic States
    <em>have not</em> “fled to the West;”—that they are not to be found
    here—that they have been blasted by the fire which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span> has passed
    over them—have sunk into their graves, and everything but their names
    travelled into oblivion.</p>

  <p>The distinctive character of all these Western Indians, as well as
    their traditions relative to their ancient locations, prove beyond a
    doubt, that they have been for a very long time located on the soil
    which they now possess; and in most respects, distinct and unlike those
    nations who formerly inhabited the Atlantic coast, and who (according
    to the erroneous opinion of a great part of the world), have fled to
    the West.</p>

  <p>It is for these inoffensive and unoffending people, yet unvisited by
    the vices of civilized society, that I would proclaim to the world,
    that it is time, for the honour of our country—for the honour of
    every citizen of the republic—and for the sake of humanity, that our
    government should raise her strong arm to save the remainder of them
    from the pestilence which is rapidly advancing upon them. We have
    gotten from them territory enough, and the country which they now
    inhabit is most of it too barren of timber for the use of civilized
    man; it affords them, however, the means and luxuries of savage life;
    and it is to be hoped that our government will not acquiesce in the
    continued wilful destruction of these happy people.</p>

  <p>My heart has sometimes almost bled with pity for them, while amongst
    them, and witnessing their innocent amusements, as I have contemplated
    the inevitable bane that was rapidly advancing upon them; without that
    check from the protecting arm of government, and which alone could
    shield them from destruction.</p>

  <p>What degree of happiness these sons of Nature may attain to in the
    world, in their own way; or in what proportion they may relish the
    pleasures of life, compared to the sum of happiness belonging to
    civilized society, has long been a subject of much doubt, and one which
    I cannot undertake to decide at this time. I would say thus much,
    however, that if the thirst for knowledge has entailed everlasting
    miseries on mankind from the beginning of the world; if refined
    and intellectual pains increase in proportion to our intellectual
    pleasures, I do not see that we gain much advantage over them on that
    score; and judging from the full-toned enjoyment which beams from their
    happy faces, I should give it as my opinion, that their lives were
    much more happy than ours; that is, if the word happiness is properly
    applied to the enjoyments of those who have not experienced the light
    of the Christian religion. I have long looked with the eye of a critic,
    into the jovial faces of these sons of the forest, unfurrowed with
    cares—where the agonizing feeling of poverty had never stamped distress
    upon the brow. I have watched the bold, intrepid step—the proud, yet
    dignified deportment of Nature’s man, in fearless freedom, with a soul
    unalloyed by mercenary lusts, too great to yield to laws or power
    except from God. As these independent fellows are all joint-tenants of
    the soil, they are all rich, and none of the steepings of comparative
    poverty can strangle their just claims to renown. Who (I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> ask)
    can look without admiring, into a society where peace and harmony
    prevail—where virtue is cherished—where rights are protected, and
    wrongs are redressed—with no laws, but the laws of honour, which are
    the supreme laws of their land. Trust the boasted virtues of civilized
    society for awhile, with all its intellectual refinements, to such a
    tribunal, and then write down the degradation of the “lawless savage,”
    and our trancendent virtues.</p>

  <p>As these people have no laws, the sovereign right of summary redress
    lies in the breast of the party (or friends of the party) aggrieved;
    and infinitely more dreaded is the certainty of cruel revenge from
    the licensed hands of an offended savage, than the slow and uncertain
    vengeance of the law.</p>

  <p>If you think me <em>enthusiast</em>, be it so; for I deny it not. It has
    ever been the predominant passion of my soul to seek Nature’s wildest
    haunts, and give my hand to Nature’s men. Legends of <em>these</em>,
    and visits to <em>those</em>, filled the earliest page of my juvenile
    impressions.</p>

  <p>The tablet has stood, and I am an enthusiast for God’s works as He left
    them.</p>

  <p>The sad tale of my native “valley,”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> has been beautifully sung; and
    from the flight of “Gertrude’s” soul, my young imagination closely
    traced the savage to his deep retreats, and gazed upon him in dreadful
    horror, until pity pleaded, and admiration worked a charm.</p>

  <p>A journey of 4000 miles from the Atlantic shore, regularly receding
    from the centre of civilized society to the extreme wilderness of
    Nature’s original work, and back again, opens a book for many an
    interesting tale to be sketched; and the mind which lives, but to
    relish the works of Nature, reaps a reward on such a tour of a much
    higher order than can arise from the selfish expectations of pecuniary
    emolument. Notwithstanding all that has been written and said, there
    is scarcely any subject on which the <em>knowing</em> people of the
    East, are yet less informed and instructed than on the character and
    amusements of the West: by this I mean the “Far West;”—the country
    whose fascinations spread a charm over the mind almost dangerous to
    civilized pursuits. Few people even know the true definition of the
    term “West;” and where is its location?—phantom-like it flies before us
    as we travel, and on our way is continually gilded, before us, as we
    approach the setting sun.</p>

  <p>In the commencement of my Tour, several of my travelling companions
    from the city of New York, found themselves at a frightful distance
    to the West, when we arrived at Niagara Falls; and hastened back to
    amuse their friends with tales and scenes of the West. At Buffalo a
    steam-boat was landing with 400 passengers, and twelve days out—“Where
    from?” “From the West.” In the rich state of Ohio, hundreds were
    selling their farms and going—to the West. In the beautiful city of
    Cincinnati, people said to me, “Our town has passed the days of its
    most rapid growth, it is not far enough West.”—In <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, 1400 miles
    west of New York, my landlady assured <span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>me that I would be pleased with
    her boarders, for they were nearly all merchants from the “West.” I
    there asked,—“Whence come those steam-boats, laden with pork, honey,
    hides, &amp;c.?”</p>

  <p>From the West.</p>

  <p>Whence those ponderous bars of silver, which those men have been for
    hours shouldering and putting on board that boat?</p>

  <p>They come from Santa Fee, from the West.</p>

  <p>Where goes this steam-boat so richly laden with dry goods,
    steam-engines, &amp;c.?</p>

  <p>She goes to Jefferson city.</p>

  <p>Jefferson city?—Where is that?</p>

  <p>Far to the West.</p>

  <p>And where goes that boat laden down to her gunnels, the Yellow Stone?</p>

  <p>She goes still farther to the West—“Then,” said I, “I’ll go to the
    West.”</p>

  <p>I went on the Yellow Stone— <span class="gesperrtstar">* * * *</span></p>

  <p><span class="gesperrtstar">* * *</span> Two thousand miles on her, and we were at the mouth of Yellow
    Stone river—at the West. What! invoices, bills of lading, &amp;c., a
    wholesale establishment so far to the West! And those strange looking,
    long-haired gentlemen, who have just arrived, and are relating the
    adventures of their long and tedious journey. Who are they?</p>

  <p>Oh! they are some of our merchants just arrived from the West.</p>

  <p>And that keel-boat, that Mackinaw-boat, and that formidable caravan,
    all of which are richly laden with goods.</p>

  <p>These, Sir, are outfits starting for the <em>West</em>.</p>

  <p>Going to the <em>West</em>, ha? “Then” said I, “I’ll try it again. I will
    try and see if I can go to the West.”</p>

  <p><span class="gesperrtstar">* * *</span> What, a Fort here, too?</p>

  <p>Oui, Monsieur—oui, Monsieur (as a dauntless, and
    <em>semibarbarian</em>-looking, jolly fellow, dashed forth in advance of
    his party on his wild horse to meet me.)</p>

  <p>What distance are you west of Yellow Stone here, my good fellow?</p>

  <p>Comment?</p>

  <p>What distance?—(stop)—quel distance?</p>

  <p>Pardón, Monsieur, je ne sais pas, Monsieur.</p>

  <p>Ne parlez vous l’Anglais?</p>

  <p>Non, Monsr. I speaks de French and de Americaine; mais je ne parle pas
    l’Anglais.</p>

  <p>“Well then, my good fellow, I will speak English, and you may speak
    Americaine.”</p>

  <p>Pardón, pardón, Monsieur.</p>

  <p>Well, then we will both speak Americaine.</p>

  <p>Val, sare, je suis bien content, pour for I see dat you speaks putty
    coot Americaine.</p>

  <p>What may I call your name?</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

  <p>Ba’tiste, Monsieur.</p>

  <p>What Indians are those so splendidly dressed, and with such fine
    horses, encamped on the plain yonder?</p>

  <p>Ils sont Corbeaux.</p>

  <p>Crows, ha?</p>

  <p>Yes, sare, Monsieur.</p>

  <p>We are then in the Crow country?</p>

  <p>Non, Monsieur, not putty éxact; we are in de coontrae of de dam Pieds
    noirs.</p>

  <p>Blackfeet, ha?</p>

  <p>Oui.</p>

  <p>What blue mountain is that which we see in the distance yonder?</p>

  <p>Ha, quel Montaigne? cela est la Montaigne du (pardón).</p>

  <p>Du Rochers, I suppose?</p>

  <p>Oui, Monsieur, de Rock Montaigne.</p>

  <p>You live here, I suppose?</p>

  <p>Non, Monsieur, I comes fair from de West.</p>

  <p>What, from the West! Where under the heavens is that?</p>

  <p>Wat, diable! de West? well you shall see, Monsieur, he is putty fair
    off, súppose. Monsieur Pierre Chouteau can give you de histoire de ma
    vie—il bien sait que je prends les castors, very fair in de West.</p>

  <p>You carry goods, I suppose, to trade with the Snake Indians beyond the
    mountains, and trap beaver also?</p>

  <p>Oui, Monsieur.</p>

  <p>Do you see anything of the “Flat-heads” in your country?</p>

  <p>Non, Monsieur, ils demeurent very, <em>very</em> fair to de West.</p>

  <p>Well, Ba’tiste, I’ll lay my course back again for the present, and at
    some future period, endeavour to go to the “West.” But you say you
    trade with the Indians and trap beavers; you are in the employment of
    the American Fur Company, I suppose?</p>

  <p>Non, Monsieur, not quite éxact; mais, súppose, I am “<em>free
    trappare</em>,” free, Monsr. free.</p>

  <p>Free trapper, what’s that? I don’t understand you, Ba’tiste.</p>

  <p>Well, Monsr. súppose he is easy pour understand—you shall know all.
    In de first place, I am enlist for tree year in de Fur Comp in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Louis—for bounté—pour bounté, eighty dollare (understand, ha?) den I
    am go for wages, et I ave come de Missouri up, et I am trap castors
    putty much for six years, you see, until I am learn very much; and den
    you see, Monsr. M‘Kenzie is give me tree horse—one pour ride, et two
    pour pack (mais he is not buy, him not give, he is lend), and he is
    lend twelve trap; and I ave make start into de Rocky Montaigne, et I am
    live all álone on de leet rivares pour prendre les castors. Sometime
    six months—sometime five month, and I come back to Yel Stone, et Monsr.
    M‘Kenzie is give me coot price pour all.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

  <p>So Mr. M‘Kenzie fits you out, and takes your beaver of you at a certain
    price?</p>

  <p>Oui, Monsr. oui.</p>

  <p>What price does he pay you for your beaver, Ba’tiste?</p>

  <p>Ha! súppose one dollare pour one beavare.</p>

  <p>A dollar per skin, ah?</p>

  <p>Oui.</p>

  <p>Well, you must live a lonesome and hazardous sort of life; can you make
    anything by it?</p>

  <p>Oh! oui, Monsr. putty coot, mais if it is not pour for de dam rascalité
    Riccaree, et de dam Pieds noirs, de Blackfoot Ingin, I am make very
    much monnair, mais (sacré), I am rob—rob—rob too much!</p>

  <p>What, do the Blackfeet rob you of your furs?</p>

  <p>Oui, Monsr. rob, súppose, five time! I am been free trappare seven
    year, et I am rob five time—I am someting left not at all—he is take
    all; he is take all de horse—he is take my gun—he is take all my
    clothes—he is takee de castors—et I am come back with foot. So in
    de Fort, some cloths is cost putty much monnair, et some whiskey is
    give sixteen dollares pour gall; so you see I am owe de Fur Comp 600
    dollare, by Gar!</p>

  <p>Well, Ba’tiste, this then is what you call being a free trapper is it?</p>

  <p>Oui, Monsr. “free trappare,” free!</p>

  <p>You seem to be going down towards the Yellow Stone, and probably have
    been out on a trapping excursion.</p>

  <p>Oui, Monsr. c’est vrai.</p>

  <p>Have you been robbed this time, Ba’tiste?</p>

  <p>Oui, Monsr. by de dam Pieds noirs—I am loose much; I am loose all—very
    all——eh bien——pour le dernier—c’est le dernier fois, Monsr. I am go to
    Yel Stone—I am go le Missouri down, I am go to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis.</p>

  <p>Well, Ba’tiste, I am to figure about in this part of the world a few
    weeks longer, and then I shall descend the Missouri from the mouth of
    Yellow Stone, to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis; and I should like exceedingly to employ
    just such a man as you are as a voyageur with me—I will give you good
    wages, and pay all your expenses; what say you?</p>

  <p>Avec tout mon cour, Monsr. remercie, remercie.</p>

  <p>It’s a bargain then, Ba’tiste; I will see you at the mouth of Yellow
    Stone.</p>

  <p>Oui, Monsr. in de Yel Stone, bon soir, bon soir, Monsr.</p>

  <p>But stop, Ba’tiste, you told me those were Crows encamped yonder.</p>

  <p>Oui, Monsieur, oui, des Corbeaux.</p>

  <p>And I suppose you are their interpreter?</p>

  <p>Non, Monsieur.</p>

  <p>But you speak the Crow language?</p>

  <p>Ouis, Monsieur.</p>

  <p>Well then, turn about; I am going to pay them a visit, and you can
    render me a service.—Bien, Monsieur, allons.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MANDAN VILLAGE, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after the writing of my last Letter, which was dated at the Mouth
    of Yellow Stone, I embarked on the river for this place, where I landed
    safely; and have resided for a couple of weeks, a guest in this almost
    subterraneous city—the strangest place in the world; where one sees
    in the most rapid succession, scenes which force him to mirth—to pity
    and compassion—to admiration—disgust; to fear and astonishment. But
    before I proceed to reveal them, I must give you a brief sketch of my
    voyage down the river from the Mouth of the Yellow Stone river to this
    place, a distance of 200 miles; and which my little note-book says, was
    performed somewhat in the following manner:</p>

  <p>When I had completed my rambles and my sketches in those regions, and
    Ba’tiste and Bogard had taken their last spree, and fought their last
    battles, and forgotten them in the final and affectionate embrace and
    farewell (all of which are habitual with these game-fellows, when
    settling up their long-standing accounts with their fellow-trappers
    of the mountain streams); and after Mr. M‘Kenzie had procured for me
    a snug little craft, that was to waft us down the mighty torrent; we
    launched off one fine morning, taking our leave of the Fort, and the
    friends within it; and also, for ever, of the beautiful green fields,
    and hills, and dales, and prairie bluffs, that encompass the enchanting
    shores of the Yellow Stone.</p>

  <p>Our canoe, which was made of green timber, was heavy and awkward; but
    our course being with the current, promised us a fair and successful
    voyage. Ammunition was laid in in abundance—a good stock of dried
    buffalo tongues—a dozen or two of beavers’ tails—and a good supply of
    pemican. Bogard and Ba’tiste occupied the middle and bow, with their
    paddles in their hands; and I took my seat in the stern of the boat,
    at the steering oar. Our larder was as I have said; and added to that,
    some few pounds of fresh buffalo meat.</p>

  <p>Besides which, and ourselves, our little craft carried several
    packs of Indian dresses and other articles, which I had purchased
    of the Indians; and also my canvass and easel, and our culinary
    articles, which were few and simple;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span> consisting of three tin cups, a
    coffee-pot—one plate—a frying-pan—and a tin kettle.</p>

  <p>Thus fitted out and embarked, we swept off at a rapid rate under the
    shouts of the savages, and the cheers of our friends, who lined the
    banks as we gradually lost sight of them, and turned our eyes towards
    <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, which was 2000 miles below us, with nought intervening, save
    the widespread and wild regions, inhabited by the roaming savage.</p>

  <p>At the end of our first day’s journey, we found ourselves handily
    encamping with several thousand Assinneboins, who had pitched their
    tents upon the bank of the river, and received us with every mark of
    esteem and friendship.</p>

  <p>In the midst of this group, was my friend Wi-jun-jon (the pigeon’s
    egg head), still lecturing on the manners and customs of the “pale
    faces.” Continuing to relate without any appearance of exhaustion, the
    marvellous scenes which he had witnessed amongst the white people, on
    his tour to Washington City.</p>

  <p>Many were the gazers who seemed to be the whole time crowding around
    him, to hear his recitals; and the plight which he was in rendered his
    appearance quite ridiculous. His beautiful military dress, of which I
    before spoke, had been so shockingly tattered and metamorphosed, that
    his appearance was truly laughable.</p>

  <p>His keg of whiskey had dealt out to his friends all its charms—his
    frock-coat, which his wife had thought was of no earthly use below
    the waist, had been cut off at that place, and the nether half of it
    supplied her with a beautiful pair of leggings; and his silver-laced
    hat-band had been converted into a splendid pair of garters for the
    same. His umbrella the poor fellow still affectionately held on to,
    and kept spread at all times. As I before said, his theme seemed to
    be exhaustless, and he, in the estimation of his tribe, to be an
    unexampled liar.</p>

  <p>Of the village of Assinneboins we took leave on the following morning,
    and rapidly made our way down the river. The rate of the current
    being four or five miles per hour, through one continued series of
    picturesque grass-covered bluffs and knolls, which everywhere had the
    appearance of an old and highly-cultivated country, with houses and
    fences removed.</p>

  <p>There is, much of the way, on one side or the other, a bold and abrupt
    precipice of three or four hundred feet in elevation, presenting itself
    in an exceedingly rough and picturesque form, to the shore of the
    river; sloping down from the summit level of the prairies above, which
    sweep off from the brink of the precipice, almost level, to an unknown
    distance.</p>

  <p>It is along the rugged and wild fronts of these cliffs, whose sides are
    generally formed of hard clay, that the mountain-sheep dwell, and are
    often discovered in great numbers. Their habits are much like those
    of the goat; and in every respect they are like that animal, except
    in the horns, which resemble those of the ram; sometimes making two
    entire circles in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span> coil; and at the roots, each horn is, in some
    instances, from five to six inches in breadth.</p>

  <p>On the second day of our voyage we discovered a number of these
    animals skipping along the sides of the precipice, always keeping
    about equi-distant between the top and bottom of the ledge; leaping
    and vaulting in the most extraordinary manner from point to point, and
    seeming to cling actually, to the sides of the wall, where neither man
    nor beast could possibly follow them.</p>

  <p>We landed our canoe, and endeavoured to shoot one of these sagacious
    animals; and after he had led us a long and fruitless chase, amongst
    the cliffs, we thought we had fairly entrapped him in such a way as to
    be sure to bring him, at last, within the command of our rifles; when
    he suddenly bounded from his narrow foot-hold in the ledge, and tumbled
    down a distance of more than a hundred feet, amongst the fragments of
    rocks and clay, where I thought we must certainly find his carcass
    without further trouble; when, to my great surprise, I saw him bounding
    off, and he was almost instantly out of my sight.</p>

  <p>Bogard, who was an old hunter, and well acquainted with these
    creatures, shouldered his rifle, and said to me—“the game is up; and
    you now see the use of those big horns; when they fall by accident, or
    find it necessary to quit their foot-hold in the crevice, they fall
    upon their head at a great distance unharmed, even though it should be
    on the solid rock.”</p>

  <p>Being on shore, and our canoe landed secure, we whiled away the greater
    part of this day amongst the wild and ragged cliffs, into which we had
    entered; and a part of our labours were vainly spent in the pursuit
    of a war-eagle. This noble bird is the one which the Indians in these
    regions, value so highly for their tail feathers, which are used as
    the most valued plumes for decorating the heads and dresses of their
    warriors. It is a beautiful bird, and, the Indians tell me, conquers
    all other varieties of eagles in the country; from which circumstance,
    the Indians respect the bird, and hold it in the highest esteem, and
    value its quills. I am unable so say to what variety it belongs; but
    I am sure it is not to be seen in any of our museums; nor is it to be
    found in America (I think), until one gets near to the base of the
    Rocky Mountains. This bird has often been called the calumet eagle and
    war-eagle; the last of which appellations I have already accounted
    for; and the other has arisen from the fact, that the Indians almost
    invariably ornament their calumets or pipes of peace with its quills.</p>

  <p>Our day’s loitering brought us through many a wild scene; occasionally
    across the tracks of the grizzly bear, and, in sight merely of a band
    of buffaloes; “which got the wind of us,” and were out of the way,
    leaving us to return to our canoe at night, with a mere speck of good
    luck. Just before we reached the river, I heard the crack of a rifle,
    and in a few moments Bogard came in sight, and threw down from his
    shoulders a fine antelope; which added to our larder, and we were
    ready to proceed. We embarked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span> and travelled until nightfall, when
    we encamped on a beautiful little prairie at the base of a series of
    grass-covered bluffs; and the next morning cooked our breakfast and
    ate it, and rowed on until late in the afternoon; when we stopped at
    the base of some huge clay bluffs, forming one of the most curious
    and romantic scenes imaginable. At this spot the river expands itself
    into the appearance somewhat of a beautiful lake; and in the midst of
    it, and on and about its sand-bars, floated and stood, hundreds and
    thousands of white swans and pelicans.</p>

  <p>Though the scene in front of our encampment at this place was placid
    and beautiful; with its flowing water—its wild fowl—and its almost
    endless variety of gracefully sloping hills and green prairies in the
    distance; yet it was not less wild and picturesque in our rear, where
    the rugged and various coloured bluffs were grouped in all the wildest
    fancies and rudeness of Nature’s accidental varieties.</p>

  <p>The whole country behind us seemed to have been dug and thrown up into
    huge piles, as if some giant mason had been there mixing his mortar
    and paints, and throwing together his rude models for some sublime
    structure of a colossal city;—with its walls—its domes—its ramparts—its
    huge porticos and galleries—its castles—its fosses and ditches;—and in
    the midst of his progress, he had abandoned his works to the destroying
    hand of time, which had already done much to tumble them down, and
    deface their noble structure; by jostling them together, with all their
    vivid colours, into an unsystematic and unintelligible mass of sublime
    ruins.</p>

  <p>To this group of clay bluffs, which line the river for many miles in
    distance, the voyageurs have very appropriately given the name of “the
    Brick-kilns;” owing to their red appearance, which may be discovered in
    a clear day at the distance of many leagues.</p>

  <p>By the action of water, or other power, the country seems to have been
    graded away; leaving occasionally a solitary mound or bluff, rising in
    a conical form to the height of two or three hundred feet, generally
    pointed or rounded at the top, and in some places grouped together
    in great numbers; some of which having a tabular surface on the top,
    and covered with a green turf. This fact (as all of those which are
    horizontal on their tops, and corresponding exactly with the summit
    level of the wide-spreading prairies in distance) clearly shows, that
    their present isolated and rounded forms have been produced by the
    action of waters: which have carried away the intervening earth, and
    left them in the picturesque shapes in which they are now seen.</p>

  <p>A similar formation (or <em>de</em>formation) may be seen in hundreds of
    places on the shores of the Missouri river, and the actual progress
    of the operation by which it is produced; leaving yet for the
    singularity of this place, the peculiar feature, that nowhere else
    (to my knowledge) occurs; that the superstratum, forming the tops of
    these mounds (where they remain high enough to support anything of
    the original surface) is composed, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span> depth of fifteen feet, of
    red pumice; terminating at its bottom, in a layer of several feet of
    sedimentary deposite, which is formed into endless conglomerates of
    basaltic crystals.</p>

  <p>This strange feature in the country arrests the eye of a traveller
    suddenly, and as instantly brings him to the conclusion, that he stands
    in the midst of the ruins of an extinguished volcano.</p>

  <p>As will be seen in the drawings (<a href="#i_037"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 37</a>, a near view,
    and <a href="#i_038"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 38</a>, a distant view), the sides of these conical
    bluffs (which are composed of strata of different coloured clays), are
    continually washing down by the effect of the rains and melting of the
    frost; and the superincumbent masses of pumice and basalt are crumbling
    off, and falling down to their bases; and from thence, in vast
    quantities, by the force of the gorges of water which are often cutting
    their channels between them—carried into the river, which is close by;
    and wafted for thousands of miles, floating as light as a cork upon its
    surface, and lodging in every pile of drift-wood from this place to the
    ocean.</p>

  <p>The upper part of this layer of pumice is of a brilliant red; and when
    the sun is shining upon it, is as bright and vivid as vermilion. It is
    porous and open, and its specific gravity but trifling. These curious
    bluffs must be seen as they are in nature; or else in a painting, where
    their colours are faithfully given, or they lose their picturesque
    beauty, which consists in the variety of their vivid tints. The strata
    of clay are alternating from red to yellow—white—brown and dark blue;
    and so curiously arranged, as to form the most pleasing and singular
    effects.</p>

  <p>During the day that I loitered about this strange scene, I left my
    men stretched upon the grass, by the canoe; and taking my rifle and
    sketch-book in my hand, I wandered and clambered through the rugged
    defiles between the bluffs; passing over and under the immense blocks
    of the pumice, that had fallen to their bases; determined, if possible,
    to find the crater, or source, from whence these strange phenomena
    had sprung; but after clambering and squeezing about for some time,
    I unfortunately came upon the enormous tracks of a grizzly bear,
    which, apparently, was travelling in the same direction (probably for
    a very different purpose) but a few moments before me; and my ardour
    for exploring was instantly so cooled down, that I hastily retraced
    my steps, and was satisfied with making my drawings, and collecting
    specimens of the lava and other minerals in its vicinity.</p>

  <p>After strolling about during the day, and contemplating the beauty of
    the scenes that were around me, while I sat upon the pinnacles of these
    pumice-capped mounds; most of which time, Bogard and Ba’tiste laid
    enjoying the pleasure of a “mountaineer’s nap”—we met together—took
    our coffee and dried buffalo tongues—spread our buffalo robes upon the
    grass, and enjoyed during the night the luxury of sleep, that belongs
    so peculiarly to the tired voyageur in these realms of pure air and
    dead silence.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

  <p>In the morning, and before sunrise, as usual, Bogard (who was a Yankee,
    and a “wide-awake-fellow,” just retiring from a ten years’ siege of
    hunting and trapping in the Rocky Mountains,) thrust his head out from
    under the robe, rubbing his eyes open, and exclaiming as he grasped
    for his gun, “By darn, look at old Cale! will you!” Ba’tiste, who was
    more fond of his dreams, snored away, muttering something that I could
    not understand, when Bogard seized him with a grip, that instantly
    shook off his iron slumbers. I rose at the same time, and all eyes were
    turned at once upon <em>Caleb</em> (as the grizzly bear is familiarly
    called by the trappers in the Rocky Mountains—or more often “Cale,”
    for brevity’s sake), who was sitting up in the dignity and fury of her
    sex, within a few rods, and gazing upon us, with her two little cubs
    at her side! here was a “<em>fix</em>,” and a subject for the painter;
    but I had no time to sketch it—I turned my eyes to the canoe which had
    been fastened at the shore a few paces from us; and saw that everything
    had been pawed out of it, and all eatables had been without ceremony
    devoured. My packages of dresses and Indian curiosities had been drawn
    out upon the bank, and deliberately opened and inspected. Every thing
    had been scraped and pawed out, to the bottom of the boat; and even
    the rawhide thong, with which it was tied to a stake, had been chewed,
    and no doubt swallowed, as there was no trace of it remaining. Nor was
    this peep into the secrets of our luggage enough for her insatiable
    curiosity—we saw by the prints of her huge paws, that were left in the
    ground, that she had been perambulating our humble mattresses, smelling
    at our toes and our noses, without choosing to molest us; verifying a
    trite saying of the country, “That man lying down is <em>medicine</em> to
    the grizzly bear;” though it is a well-known fact, that man and beast,
    upon their feet, are sure to be attacked when they cross the path of
    this grizzly and grim monster, which is the terror of all this country;
    often growing to the enormous size of eight hundred or one thousand
    pounds.</p>

  <p>Well—whilst we sat in the dilemma which I have just described, each
    one was hastily preparing his weapons for defence, when I proposed the
    mode of attack; by which means I was in hopes to destroy her—capture
    her young ones, and bring her skin home as a trophy. My plans, however,
    entirely failed, though we were well armed; for Bogard and Ba’tiste
    both remonstrated with a vehemence that was irresistible; saying that
    the standing rule in the mountains was “never to fight Caleb, except
    in self-defence.” I was almost induced, however, to attack her alone,
    with my rifle in hand, and a pair of heavy pistols; with a tomahawk
    and scalping-knife in my belt; when Ba’tiste suddenly thrust his arm
    over my shoulder and pointing in another direction, exclaimed in an
    emphatic tone, “Voila! voila un corps de reserve—Monsr. Cataline—voila
    sa mari! allons—allons! déscendons la riviére, toute de suite! toute
    de suite! Monsr.” to which Bogard added, “these darned animals are too
    much for us, and we had better be off;” at which my courage cooled, and
    we packed up and re-embarked as fast as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span> possible; giving each one of
    them the contents of our rifles as we drifted off in the current; which
    brought the she-monster, in all her rage and fury, to the spot where
    we, a few moments before, had passed our most prudent resolve.</p>

  <p>During the rest of this day, we passed on rapidly, gazing upon and
    admiring the beautiful shores, which were continually changing, from
    the high and ragged cliffs, to the graceful and green slopes of the
    prairie bluffs; and then to the wide expanded meadows, with their long
    waving grass, enamelled with myriads of wild flowers.</p>

  <p>The scene was one of enchantment the whole way; our chief conversation
    was about grizzly bears and hair’s-breadth escapes; of the histories
    of which my companions had volumes in store.—Our breakfast was a late
    one—cooked and eaten about five in the afternoon; at which time our
    demolished larder was luckily replenished by the unerring rifle of
    Bogard, which brought down a fine antelope, as it was innocently gazing
    at us, from the bank of the river. We landed our boat, and took in
    our prize; but there being no wood for our fire, we shoved off, and
    soon ran upon the head of an island, that was covered with immense
    quantities of raft and drift wood, where we easily kindled a huge fire
    and ate our delicious meal from a clean peeled log, astride of which
    we comfortably sat, making it answer admirably the double purpose of
    chairs and a table. After our meal was finished, we plied the paddles,
    and proceeded several miles further on our course; leaving our fire
    burning, and dragging our canoe upon the shore, in the dark, in a wild
    and unknown spot; and silently spreading our robes for our slumbers,
    which it is not generally considered prudent to do by the side of our
    fires, which might lead a war-party upon us, who often are prowling
    about and seeking an advantage over their enemy.</p>

  <p>The scenery of this day’s travel, as I have before said, was
    exceedingly beautiful; and our canoe was often run to the shore,
    upon which we stepped to admire the endless variety of wild flowers,
    “wasting their sweetness on the desert air,” and the abundance of
    delicious fruits that were about us. Whilst wandering through the high
    grass, the wild sun-flowers and voluptuous lilies were constantly
    taunting us by striking our faces; whilst here and there, in every
    direction, there were little copses and clusters of plum trees and
    gooseberries, and wild currants, loaded down with their fruit; and
    amongst these, to sweeten the atmosphere and add a charm to the
    effect, the wild rose bushes seemed planted in beds and in hedges, and
    everywhere were decked out in all the glory of their delicate tints,
    and shedding sweet aroma to every breath of the air that passed over
    them.</p>

  <p>In addition to these, we had the luxury of service-berries, without
    stint; and the buffalo bushes, which are peculiar to these northern
    regions, lined the banks of the river and defiles in the bluffs,
    sometimes for miles together; forming almost impassable hedges,
    so loaded with the weight of their fruit, that their boughs were
    everywhere gracefully bending down and resting on the ground.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

  <p>This last shrub (<i>shepperdia</i>), which may be said to be the most
    beautiful ornament that decks out the wild prairies, forms a striking
    contrast to the rest of the foliage, from the blue appearance of its
    leaves, by which it can be distinguished for miles in distance. The
    fruit which it produces in such incredible profusion, hanging in
    clusters to every limb and to every twig, is about the size of ordinary
    currants, and not unlike them in colour and even in flavour; being
    exceedingly acid, and almost unpalatable, until they are bitten by the
    frost of autumn, when they are sweetened, and their flavour delicious;
    having, to the taste, much the character of grapes, and I am inclined
    to think, would produce excellent wine.</p>

  <p>The shrub which bears them resembles some varieties of the thorn,
    though (as I have said) differs entirely in the colour of its leaves.
    It generally grows to the height of six or seven feet, and often to
    ten or twelve; and in groves or hedges, in some places, for miles in
    extent. While gathering the fruit, and contemplating it as capable of
    producing good wine, I asked my men this question, “Suppose we three
    had ascended the river to this point in the spring of the year, and in
    a timbered bottom had pitched our little encampment; and one of you two
    had been a boat-builder, and the other a cooper—the one to have got out
    your staves and constructed the wine casks, and the other to have built
    a mackinaw-boat, capable of carrying fifty or a hundred casks; and I
    had been a good hunter, capable of supplying the little encampment with
    meat; and we should have started off about this time, to float down
    the current, stopping our boat wherever we saw the finest groves of
    the buffalo bush, collecting the berries and expressing the juice, and
    putting it into our casks for fermentation while on the water for two
    thousand miles; how many bushels of these berries could you two gather
    in a day, provided I watched the boat and cooked your meals? and how
    many barrels of good wine do you think we could offer for sale in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Louis when we should arrive there?”</p>

  <p>This idea startled my two men exceedingly, and Ba’tiste gabbled so
    fast in French, that I could not translate; and I am almost willing
    to believe, that but for the want of the requisite tools for the
    enterprize, I should have lost the company of Bogard and Ba’tiste;
    or that I should have been under the necessity of submitting to one
    of the unpleasant alternatives which are often regulated by the
    <em>majority</em>, in this strange and singular wilderness.</p>

  <p>I at length, however, got their opinions on the subject; when they
    mutually agreed that they could gather thirty bushels of this fruit
    per day; and I gave it then, and I offer it now, as my own also,
    that their estimate was not out of the way, and judged so from the
    experiments which we made in the following manner:—We several times
    took a large mackinaw blanket which I had in the canoe, and spreading
    it on the ground under the bushes, where they were the most abundantly
    loaded with fruit; and by striking the stalk of the tree with a club,
    we received the whole contents of its branches in an instant on the
    blanket, which was taken up by the corners, and not unfrequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> would
    produce us, from one blow, the eighth part of a bushel of this fruit;
    when the boughs relieved of their burden, instantly flew up to their
    native position.</p>

  <p>Of this beautiful native, which I think would form one of the loveliest
    ornamental shrubs for a gentleman’s park or pleasure grounds, I
    procured a number of the roots; but which, from the many accidents and
    incidents that our unlucky bark was subjected to on our rough passage,
    I lost them (and almost the recollection of them) as well as many other
    curiosities I had collected on our way down the river.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the next day, and not long after we had stopped and
    taken our breakfast, and while our canoe was swiftly gliding along
    under the shore of a beautiful prairie, I saw in the grass, on the
    bank above me, what I supposed to be the back of a fine elk, busy at
    his grazing. I let our craft float silently by for a little distance,
    when I communicated the intelligence to my men, and slily ran in, to
    the shore. I pricked the priming of my firelock, and taking a bullet
    or two in my mouth, stepped ashore, and trailing my rifle in my hand,
    went back under the bank, carefully crawling up in a little ravine,
    quite sure of my game; when, to my utter surprise and violent alarm,
    I found the elk to be no more nor less than an Indian pony, getting
    his breakfast! and a little beyond him, a number of others grazing;
    and nearer to me, on the left, a war-party reclining around a little
    fire; and yet nearer, and within twenty paces of the muzzle of my gun,
    the naked shoulders if a brawny Indian, who seemed busily engaged in
    cleaning his gun. From this critical dilemma, the reader can easily
    imagine that I vanished with all the suddenness and secrecy that was
    possible, bending my course towards my canoe. Bogard and Ba’tiste
    correctly construing the expression of my face, and the agitation of
    my hurried retreat, prematurely unmoored from the shore; and the force
    of the current carrying them around a huge pile of drift wood, threw
    me back for some distance upon my own resources; though they finally
    got in, near the shore, and I into the boat, with the steering oar in
    my hand; when we plied our sinews with effect and in silence, till we
    were wafted far from the ground which we deemed critical and dangerous
    to our lives; for we had been daily in dread of meeting a war-party of
    the revengeful Riccarees, which we had been told was on the river, in
    search of the Mandans. From and after this exciting occurrence, the
    entries in my journal for the rest of the voyage to the village of the
    Mandans, were as follow:—</p>

  <p>Saturday, fifth day of our voyage from the mouth of Yellow Stone, at
    eleven o’clock.—Landed our canoe in the Grand Détour (or Big Bend) as
    it is called, at the base of a stately clay mound, and ascended, all
    hands, to the summit level, to take a glance at the picturesque and
    magnificent works of Nature that were about us. Spent the remainder
    of the day in painting a view of this grand scene; for which purpose
    Ba’tiste and Bogard carried my easel and canvass to the top of a
    huge mound, where they left me at my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span> work; and I painted my picture
    (<a href="#i_039"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 39</a>), whilst they amused themselves with their rifles,
    decoying a flock of antelopes, of which they killed several, and
    abundantly added to the stock of our provisions.</p>

  <p>Scarcely anything in nature can be found, I am sure, more exceedingly
    picturesque than the view from this place; exhibiting the wonderful
    manner in which the gorges of the river have cut out its deep channel
    through these walls of clay on either side, of two or three hundred
    feet in elevation; and the imposing features of the high table-lands in
    distance, standing as a perpetual anomaly in the country, and producing
    the indisputable, though astounding evidence of the fact, that there
    has been at some ancient period, a <em>super</em> surface to this
    country, corresponding with the elevation of these tabular hills, whose
    surface, for half a mile or more, on their tops, is perfectly level;
    being covered with a green turf, and yet one hundred and fifty or two
    hundred feet elevated above what may now be properly termed the summit
    level of all this section of country; as will be seen stretching off at
    their base, without furnishing other instances in hundreds of miles,
    of anything rising one foot above its surface, excepting the solitary
    group which is shewn in the painting.</p>

  <p>The fact, that <em>there</em> was once the summit level of this great
    valley, is a stubborn one, however difficult it may be to reconcile
    it with reasonable causes and results; and the mind of feeble man is
    at once almost paralyzed in endeavouring to comprehend the process
    by which the adjacent country, from this to the base of the Rocky
    Mountains, as well as in other directions, could have been swept away;
    and equally so, for knowledge of the place where its mighty deposits
    have been carried.</p>

  <p>I recollect to have seen on my way up the river, at the distance of
    six or eight hundred miles below, a place called “the Square Hills,”
    and another denominated “the Bijou Hills;” which are the only features
    on the river, seeming to correspond with this strange <em>remain</em>,
    and which, on my way down, I shall carefully examine; and not fail to
    add their testimonies (if I am not mistaken in their character) to
    further speculations on this interesting feature of the geology of the
    great valley of the Missouri. Whilst my men were yet engaged in their
    sporting excursions, I left my easel and travelled to the base and
    summit of these tabular hills; which, to my great surprise, I found to
    be several miles from the river, and a severe journey to accomplish
    getting back to our encampment at nightfall. I found by their sides
    that they were evidently of an alluvial deposite, composed of a great
    variety of horizontal layers of clays of different colours—of granitic
    sand and pebbles (many of which furnished me beautiful specimens of
    agate, jasper and carnelians), and here and there large fragments of
    pumice and cinders, which gave, as instances above-mentioned, evidences
    of volcanic remains.</p>

  <p>The mode by which Bogard and Ba’tiste had been entrapping the timid
    and sagacious antelopes was one which is frequently and successfully
    practised in this country; and on this day had afforded them fine
    sport.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

  <p>The antelope of this country, I believe to be different from all
    other known varieties, and forms one of the most pleasing, living
    ornaments to this western world. They are seen in some places in great
    numbers sporting and playing about the hills and dales; and often, in
    flocks of fifty or a hundred, will follow the boat of the descending
    voyageur, or the travelling caravan, for hours together; keeping off
    at a safe distance, on the right or left, galloping up and down the
    hills, snuffing their noses and stamping their feet; as if they were
    endeavouring to remind the traveller of the wicked trespass he was
    making on their own hallowed ground.</p>

  <p>This little animal seems to be endowed, like many other gentle and
    sweet-breathing creatures, with an undue share of curiosity, which
    often leads them to destruction; and the hunter who wishes to entrap
    them, saves himself the trouble of travelling after them. When he has
    been discovered, he has only to elevate above the tops of the grass,
    his red or yellow handkerchief on the end of his gun-rod (<a href="#i_040"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    40</a>), which he sticks in the ground, and to which they are sure to
    advance, though with great coyness and caution; whilst he lies close,
    at a little distance, with his rifle in hand; when it is quite an easy
    matter to make sure of two or three at a shot, which he gets in range
    of his eye, to be pierced with one bullet.</p>

  <p>On Sunday, departed from our encampment in the Grand Détour; and having
    passed for many miles, through a series of winding and ever-varying
    bluffs and fancied ruins, like such as have already been described,
    our attention was more than usually excited by the stupendous scene
    (<a href="#i_041"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 41</a>), called by the voyageurs “the Grand Dome,” which
    was lying in full view before us.</p>

  <p>Our canoe was here hauled ashore, and a day whiled away again, amongst
    these clay built ruins.</p>

  <p>We clambered to their summits and enjoyed the distant view of the
    Missouri for many miles below, wending its way through the countless
    groups of clay and grass-covered hills; and we wandered back on the
    plains, in a toilsome and unsuccessful pursuit of a herd of buffaloes,
    which we discovered at some distance. Though we were disappointed
    in the results of the chase; yet we were in a measure repaid in
    amusements, which we found in paying a visit to an extensive village of
    prairie dogs, and of which I should render some account.</p>

  <p>I have subjoined a sketch (<a href="#i_042"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 42</a>) of one of these
    <i>sub-terra</i> communities; though it was taken in a former
    excursion, when my party was on horseback, and near the mouth of the
    Yellow Stone River; yet it answers for this place as well as any other,
    for their habits are one and the same wherever they are found; their
    houses or burrows are all alike, and as their location is uniformly on
    a level and desolate prairie, without timber, there is little room for
    variety or dissimilarity.</p>

  <p>The prairie dog of the American Prairies is undoubtedly a variety
    of the marmot; and probably not unlike those which inhabit the vast
    Steppes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span> Asia. It bears no resemblance to any variety of dogs,
    except in the sound of its voice, when excited by the approach of
    danger, which is something like that of a very small dog, and still
    much more resembling the barking of a grey squirrel.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>22</i></div>

     <figcaption>40</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The size of these curious little animals is not far from that of a
    very large rat, and they are not unlike in their appearance. As I have
    said, their burrows, are uniformly built in a lonely desert; and away,
    both from the proximity of timber and water. Each individual, or each
    family, dig their hole in the prairie to the depth of eight or ten
    feet, throwing up the dirt from each excavation, in a little pile, in
    the form of a cone, which forms the only elevation for them to ascend;
    where they sit, to bark and chatter when an enemy is approaching their
    village. These villages are sometimes of several miles in extent;
    containing (I would almost say) myriads of their excavations and little
    dirt hillocks, and to the ears of their visitors, the din of their
    barkings is too confused and too peculiar to be described.</p>

  <p>In the present instance, we made many endeavours to shoot them, but
    finding our efforts to be entirely in vain. As we were approaching them
    at a distance, each one seemed to be perched up, on his hind feet,
    on his appropriate domicil, with a significant jerk of his tail at
    every bark, positively disputing our right of approach. I made several
    attempts to get near enough to “draw a bead” upon one of them; and
    just before I was ready to fire (and as if they knew the utmost limits
    of their safety), they sprang down into their holes, and instantly
    turning their bodies, shewed their ears and the ends of their noses, as
    they were peeping out at me; which position they would hold, until the
    shortness of the distance subjected their scalps to danger again, from
    the aim of a rifle; when they instantly disappeared from our sight,
    and all was silence thereafter, about their premises, as I passed them
    over; until I had so far advanced by them, that their ears were again
    discovered, and at length themselves, at full length, perched on the
    tops of their little hillocks and threatening as before; thus gradually
    sinking and rising like a wave before and behind me.</p>

  <p>The holes leading down to their burrows, are four or five inches in
    diameter, and run down nearly perpendicular; where they undoubtedly
    communicate into something like a subterraneous city (as I have
    formerly learned from fruitless endeavours to dig them out), undermined
    and vaulted; by which means, they can travel for a great distance under
    the ground, without danger from pursuit.</p>

  <p>Their food is simply the grass in the immediate vicinity of their
    burrows, which is cut close to the ground by their flat, shovel teeth;
    and, as they sometimes live twenty miles from any water, it is to be
    supposed that they get moisture enough from the dew on the grass, on
    which they feed chiefly at night; or that (as is generally supposed)
    they sink wells from their under-ground habitations, by which they
    descend low enough to get their supply. In the winter, they are for
    several months invisible; existing, undoubtedly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span> in a torpid state,
    as they certainly lay by no food for that season—nor can they procure
    any. These curious little animals belong to almost every latitude in
    the vast plains of prairie in North America; and their villages, which
    I have sometimes encountered in my travels, have compelled my party to
    ride several miles out of our way to get by them; for their burrows are
    generally within a few feet of each other, and dangerous to the feet
    and the limbs of our horses.</p>

  <p>The sketch of the bluffs denominated “the Grand Dome,” of which I spoke
    but a few moments since, is a faithful delineation of the lines and
    character of that wonderful scene; and the reader has here a just and
    striking illustration of the ruin-like appearances, as I have formerly
    described, that are so often met with on the banks of this mighty river.</p>

  <p>This is, perhaps, one of the most grand and beautiful scenes of the
    kind to be met with in this country, owing to the perfect appearance
    of its several huge domes, turrets, and towers, which were everywhere
    as precise and as perfect in their forms as they are represented in
    the illustration. These stupendous works are produced by the continual
    washing down of the sides of these clay-formed hills; and although, in
    many instances, their sides, by exposure, have become so hardened, that
    their change is very slow; yet they are mostly subjected to continual
    phases, more or less, until ultimately their decomposition ceases,
    and their sides becoming seeded and covered with a green turf, which
    protects and holds them (and will hold them) unalterable: with carpets
    of green, and enamelled with flowers, to be gazed upon with admiration,
    by the hardy voyageur and the tourist, for ages and centuries to come.</p>

  <p>On Monday, the seventh day from the mouth of the Yellow Stone River,
    we floated away from this noble scene; looking back again and again
    upon it, wondering at its curious and endless changes, as the swift
    current of the river, hurried us by, and gradually out of sight of it.
    We took a sort of melancholy leave of it—but at every bend and turn in
    the stream, we were introduced to others—and others—and yet others,
    almost as strange and curious. At the base of one of these, although
    we had passed it, we with difficulty landed our canoe, and I ascended
    to its top, with some hours’ labour; having to cut a foot-hold in the
    clay with my hatchet for each step, a great part of the way up its
    sides. So curious was this solitary bluff, standing alone as it did,
    to the height of 250 feet (<a href="#i_043"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 43</a>), with its sides washed
    down into hundreds of variegated forms—with large blocks of indurated
    clay, remaining upon pedestals and columns as it were, and with such
    a variety of tints; that I looked upon it as a beautiful picture, and
    devoted an hour or two with my brush, in transferring it to my canvass.</p>

  <p>In the after part of this day we passed another extraordinary scene,
    which is denominated “the Three Domes” (<a href="#i_044"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 44</a>), forming an
    exceedingly pleasing group, though requiring no further description for
    the reader, who is now sufficiently acquainted with these scenes to
    understand them.</p>

  <p>On this day, just before night, we landed our little boat in front of
    the Mandan village; and amongst the hundreds and thousands who flocked
    towards the river to meet and to greet us, was Mr. Kipp, the agent of
    the American Fur Company, who has charge of their Establishment at this
    place. He kindly ordered my canoe to be taken care of, and my things to
    be carried to his quarters, which was at once done; and I am at this
    time reaping the benefits of his genuine politeness, and gathering the
    pleasures of his amusing and interesting society.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="subheadc">MANDAN VILLAGE, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">I said</span> that I was here in the midst of a strange people, which is
    literally true; and I find myself surrounded by subjects and scenes
    worthy the pens of Irving or Cooper—of the pencils of Raphael or
    Hogarth; rich in legends and romances, which would require no aid of
    the imagination for a book or a picture.</p>

  <p>The Mandans (or See-pohs-kah-nu-mah-kah-kee, “people of the pheasants,”
    as they call themselves), are perhaps one of the most ancient tribes
    of Indians in our country. Their origin, like that of all the other
    tribes is from necessity, involved in mystery and obscurity. Their
    traditions and peculiarities I shall casually recite in this or future
    epistles; which when understood, will at once, I think, denominate
    them a peculiar and distinct race. They take great pride in relating
    their traditions, with regard to their origin; contending that they
    were the <em>first</em> people created on earth. Their existence in these
    regions has not been from a very ancient period; and, from what I could
    learn of their traditions, they have, at a former period, been a very
    numerous and powerful nation; but by the continual wars which have
    existed between them and their neighbours, they have been reduced to
    their present numbers.</p>

  <p>This tribe is at present located on the west bank of the Missouri,
    about 1800 miles above <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, and 200 below the Mouth of Yellow
    Stone river. They have two villages only, which are about two miles
    distant from each other; and number in all (as near as I can learn),
    about 2000 souls. Their present villages are beautifully located, and
    judiciously also, for defence against the assaults of their enemies.
    The site of the lower (or principal) town, in particular (<a href="#i_045"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    45</a>), is one of the most beautiful and pleasing that can be seen
    in the world, and even more beautiful than imagination could ever
    create. In the very midst of an extensive valley (embraced within a
    thousand graceful swells and parapets or mounds of interminable green,
    changing to blue, as they vanish in distance) is built the city, or
    principal town of the Mandans. On an extensive plain (which is covered
    with a green turf, as well as the hills and dales, as far as the eye
    can possibly range, without tree or bush to be seen) are to be seen
    rising from the ground, and towards the heavens, domes—(not “of gold,”
    but) of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> dirt—and the thousand spears (not “spires”) and scalp-poles,
    &amp;c. &amp;c., of the semi-subterraneous village of the hospitable and
    gentlemanly Mandans.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>25</i></div>

  <p>These people formerly (and within the recollection of many of their
    oldest men) lived fifteen or twenty miles farther down the river, in
    ten contiguous villages; the marks or ruins of which are yet plainly
    to be seen. At that period, it is evident, as well from the number of
    lodges which their villages contained, as from their traditions, that
    their numbers were much greater than at the present day.</p>

  <p>There are other, and very interesting, traditions and historical facts
    relative to a still prior location and condition of these people,
    of which I shall speak more fully on a future occasion. From these,
    when they are promulged, I think there may be a pretty fair deduction
    drawn, that they formerly occupied the lower part of the Missouri, and
    even the Ohio and Muskingum, and have gradually made their way up the
    Missouri to where they now are.</p>

  <p>There are many remains on the river below this place (and, in fact,
    to be seen nearly as low down as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis), which shew clearly the
    peculiar construction of Mandan lodges, and consequently carry a strong
    proof of the above position. While descending the river, however, which
    I shall commence in a few weeks, in a canoe, this will be a subject of
    interest; and I shall give it close examination.</p>

  <p>The ground on which the Mandan village is at present built, was
    admirably selected for defence; being on a bank forty or fifty feet
    above the bed of the river. The greater part of this bank is nearly
    perpendicular, and of solid rock. The river, suddenly changing its
    course to a right-angle, protects two sides of the village, which is
    built upon this promontory or angle; they have therefore but one side
    to protect, which is effectually done by a strong piquet, and a ditch
    inside of it, of three or four feet in depth. The piquet is composed
    of timbers of a foot or more in diameter, and eighteen feet high, set
    firmly in the ground at sufficient distances from each other to admit
    of guns and other missiles to be fired between them. The ditch (unlike
    that of civilized modes of fortification) is inside of the piquet, in
    which their warriors screen their bodies from the view and weapons of
    their enemies, whilst they are reloading and discharging their weapons
    through the piquets.</p>

  <p>The Mandans are undoubtedly secure in their villages, from the attacks
    of any Indian nation, and have nothing to fear, except when they meet
    their enemy on the prairie. Their village has a most novel appearance
    to the eye of a stranger; their lodges are closely grouped together,
    leaving but just room enough for walking and riding between them; and
    appear from without, to be built entirely of dirt; but one is surprised
    when he enters them, to see the neatness, comfort, and spacious
    dimensions of these earth-covered dwellings. They all have a circular
    form, and are from forty to sixty feet in diameter. Their foundations
    are prepared by digging some two feet in the ground, and forming the
    floor of earth, by levelling the requisite size for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span> the lodge. These
    floors or foundations are all perfectly circular, and varying in size
    in proportion to the number of inmates, or of the quality or standing
    of the families which are to occupy them. The superstructure is then
    produced, by arranging, inside of this circular excavation, firmly
    fixed in the ground and resting against the bank, a barrier or wall of
    timbers, some eight or nine inches in diameter, of equal height (about
    six feet) placed on end, and resting against each other, supported by
    a formidable embankment of earth raised against them outside; then,
    resting upon the tops of these timbers or piles, are others of equal
    size and equal in numbers, of twenty or twenty-five feet in length,
    resting firmly against each other, and sending their upper or smaller
    ends towards the centre and top of the lodge; rising at an angle of
    forty-five degrees to the apex or sky-light, which is about three or
    four feet in diameter, answering as a chimney and a sky-light at the
    same time. The roof of the lodge being thus formed, is supported by
    beams passing around the inner part of the lodge about the middle of
    these poles or timbers, and themselves upheld by four or five large
    posts passing down to the floor of the lodge. On the top of, and over
    the poles forming the roof, is placed a complete mat of willow-boughs,
    of half a foot or more in thickness, which protects the timbers from
    the dampness of the earth, with which the lodge is covered from bottom
    to top, to the depth of two or three feet; and then with a hard or
    tough clay, which is impervious to water, and which with long use
    becomes quite hard, and a lounging place for the whole family in
    pleasant weather—for sage—for wooing lovers—for dogs and all; an airing
    place—a look-out—a place for gossip and mirth—a seat for the solitary
    gaze and meditations of the stern warrior, who sits and contemplates
    the peaceful mirth and happiness that is breathed beneath him, fruits
    of his hard-fought battles, on fields of desperate combat with
    bristling Red Men.</p>

  <p>The floors of these dwellings are of earth, but so hardened by use, and
    swept so clean, and tracked by bare and moccassined feet, that they
    have almost a polish, and would scarcely soil the whitest linen. In the
    centre, and immediately under the sky-light (<a href="#i_046"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 46</a>) is the
    fire-place—a hole of four or five feet in diameter, of a circular form,
    sunk a foot or more below the surface, and curbed around with stone.
    Over the fire-place, and suspended from the apex of diverging props or
    poles, is generally seen the pot or kettle, filled with buffalo meat;
    and around it are the family, reclining in all the most picturesque
    attitudes and groups, resting on their buffalo-robes and beautiful mats
    of rushes. These cabins are so spacious, that they hold from twenty
    to forty persons—a family and all their connexions. They all sleep on
    bedsteads similar in form to ours, but generally not quite so high;
    made of round poles rudely lashed together with thongs. A buffalo skin,
    fresh stripped from the animal, is stretched across the bottom poles,
    and about two feet from the floor; which, when it dries, becomes much
    contracted, and forms a perfect sacking-bottom. The fur side of this
    skin is placed uppermost, on which they lie with great comfort, with
    a buffalo-robe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> folded up for a pillow, and others drawn over them
    instead of blankets. These beds, as far as I have seen them (and I have
    visited almost every lodge in the village), are uniformly screened with
    a covering of buffalo or elk skins, oftentimes beautifully dressed
    and placed over the upright poles or frame, like a suit of curtains;
    leaving a hole in front, sufficiently spacious for the occupant to pass
    in and out, to and from his or her bed. Some of these coverings or
    curtains are exceedingly beautiful, being cut tastefully into fringe,
    and handsomely ornamented with porcupine’s quills and picture writings
    or hieroglyphics.</p>

  <p>From the great number of inmates in these lodges, they are necessarily
    very spacious, and the number of beds considerable. It is no uncommon
    thing to see these lodges fifty feet in diameter inside (which is an
    immense room), with a row of these curtained beds extending quite
    around their sides, being some ten or twelve of them, placed four or
    five feet apart, and the space between them occupied by a large post,
    fixed quite firm in the ground, and six or seven feet high, with
    large wooden pegs or bolts in it, on which are hung and grouped, with
    a wild and startling taste, the arms and armour of the respective
    proprietor; consisting of his whitened shield, embossed and emblazoned
    with the figure of his protecting <em>medicine</em> (or mystery), his
    bow and quiver, his war-club or battle-axe, his dart or javelin—his
    tobacco pouch and pipe—his medicine-bag—and his eagle—ermine or raven
    head-dress; and over all, and on the top of the post (as if placed
    by some conjuror or Indian magician, to guard and protect the spell
    of wildness that reigns in this strange place), stands forth and in
    full relief the head and horns of a buffalo, which is, by a village
    regulation, owned and possessed by every man in the nation, and hung at
    the head of his bed, which he uses as a mask when called upon by the
    chiefs, to join in the buffalo-dance, of which I shall say more in a
    future epistle.</p>

  <p>This arrangement of beds, of arms, &amp;c., combining the most vivid
    display and arrangement of colours, of furs, of trinkets—of barbed and
    glistening points and steel—of mysteries and hocus pocus, together
    with the sombre and smoked colour of the roof and sides of the
    lodge; and the wild, and rude and red—the graceful (though uncivil)
    conversational, garrulous, story-telling and happy, though ignorant
    and untutored groups, that are smoking their pipes—wooing their
    sweethearts, and embracing their little ones about their peaceful and
    endeared fire-sides; together with their pots and kettles, spoons,
    and other culinary articles of their own manufacture, around them;
    present altogether, one of the most picturesque scenes to the eye of a
    stranger, that can be possibly seen; and far more wild and vivid than
    could ever be imagined.</p>

  <p>Reader, I said these people were garrulous, story-telling and happy;
    this is true, and literally so; and it belongs to me to establish the
    fact, and correct the error which seems to have gone forth to the world
    on this subject.</p>

  <p>As I have before observed, there is no subject that I know of within
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span> scope and reach of human wisdom, on which the civilized world in
    this enlightened age are more incorrectly informed, than upon that
    of the true manners and customs, and moral condition, rights and
    abuses, of the North American Indians; and that, as I have also before
    remarked, chiefly on account of the difficulty of our cultivating a
    fair and honourable acquaintance with them, and doing them the justice,
    and ourselves the credit, of a fair and impartial investigation of
    their true character. The present age of refinement and research has
    brought every thing else that I know of (and a vast deal more than
    the most enthusiastic mind ever dreamed of) within the scope and fair
    estimation of refined intellect and of science; while the wild and
    timid savage, with his interesting customs and modes has vanished, or
    his character has become changed, at the approach of the enlightened
    and intellectual world; who follow him like a phantom for awhile, and
    in ignorance of his true character at last turn back to the common
    business and social transactions of life.</p>

  <p>Owing to the above difficulties, which have stood in the way, the world
    have fallen into many egregious errors with regard to the true modes
    and meaning of the savage, which I am striving to set forth and correct
    in the course of these epistles. And amongst them all, there is none
    more common, nor more entirely erroneous, nor more easily refuted,
    than the current one, that “the Indian is a sour, morose, reserved and
    taciturn man.” I have heard this opinion advanced a thousand times and
    I believed it; but such certainly, is not uniformly nor generally the
    case.</p>

  <p>I have observed in all my travels amongst the Indian tribes, and
    more particularly amongst these unassuming people, that they are a
    far more talkative and conversational race than can easily be seen
    in the civilized world. This assertion, like many others I shall
    occasionally make, will somewhat startle the folks at the East, yet
    it is true. No one can look into the wigwams of these people, or into
    any little momentary group of them, without being at once struck with
    the conviction that small-talk, gossip, garrulity, and story-telling,
    are the leading passions with them, who have little else to do in
    the world, but to while away their lives in the innocent and endless
    amusement of the exercise of those talents with which Nature has
    liberally endowed them, for their mirth and enjoyment.</p>

  <p>One has but to walk or ride about this little town and its environs
    for a few hours in a pleasant day, and overlook the numerous games and
    gambols, where their notes and yelps of exultation are unceasingly
    vibrating in the atmosphere; or peep into their wigwams (and watch
    the glistening fun that’s beaming from the noses, cheeks, and chins,
    of the crouching, cross-legged, and prostrate groups around the fire;
    where the pipe is passed, and jokes and anecdote, and laughter are
    excessive) to become convinced that it is natural to laugh and be
    merry. Indeed it would be strange if a race of people like these, who
    have little else to do or relish in life, should be curtailed in that
    source of pleasure and amusement; and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span> would be also strange, if a
    life-time of indulgence and practice in so innocent and productive a
    mode of amusement, free from the cares and anxieties of business or
    professions, should not advance them in their modes, and enable them to
    draw far greater pleasure from such sources, than we in the civilized
    and business world can possibly feel. If the uncultivated condition of
    their minds curtails the number of their enjoyments; yet they are free
    from, and independent of, a thousand cares and jealousies, which arise
    from mercenary motives in the civilized world; and are yet far a-head
    of us (in my opinion) in the real and uninterrupted enjoyment of their
    simple natural faculties.</p>

  <p>They live in a country and in communities, where it is not customary
    to look forward into the future with concern, for they live without
    incurring the expenses of life, which are absolutely necessary and
    unavoidable in the enlightened world; and of course their inclinations
    and faculties are solely directed to the enjoyment of the present day,
    without the sober reflections on the past or apprehensions of the
    future.</p>

  <p>With minds thus unexpanded and uninfluenced by the thousand passions
    and ambitions of civilized life, it is easy and natural to concentrate
    their thoughts and their conversation upon the little and trifling
    occurrences of their lives. They are fond of fun and good cheer, and
    can laugh easily and heartily at a slight joke, of which their peculiar
    modes of life furnish them an inexhaustible fund, and enable them to
    cheer their little circle about the wigwam fire-side with endless
    laughter and garrulity.</p>

  <p>It may be thought, that I am taking a great deal of pains to establish
    this fact, and I am dwelling longer upon it than I otherwise should,
    inasmuch as I am opposing an error that seems to have become current
    through the world; and which, if it be once corrected, removes a
    material difficulty, which has always stood in the way of a fair and
    just estimation of the Indian character. For the purpose of placing
    the Indian in a proper light before the world, as I hope to do in
    many respects, it is of importance to me—it is but justice to the
    savage—and justice to my readers also, that such points should be
    cleared up as I proceed; and for the world who enquire for correct and
    just information, they must take my words for the truth, or else come
    to this country and look for themselves, into these grotesque circles
    of never-ending laughter and fun, instead of going to Washington
    City to gaze on the poor embarrassed Indian who is called there by
    his “Great Father,” to contend with the sophistry of the learned and
    acquisitive world, in bartering away his lands with the graves and the
    hunting grounds of his ancestors. There is not the proper place to
    study the Indian character; yet it is the place where the sycophant and
    the scribbler go to gaze and frown upon him—to learn his character,
    and write his history! and because he does not speak, and quaffs the
    delicious beverage which he receives from white men’s hands, “he’s a
    speechless brute and a drunkard.” An Indian is a beggar in Washington
    City, and a white man is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> almost equally so in the Mandan village. An
    Indian in Washington is mute, is dumb and embarrassed; and so is a
    white man (and for the very same reasons) in this place—he has nobody
    to talk to.</p>

  <p>A wild Indian, to reach the civilized world, must needs travel
    some thousands of miles in vehicles of conveyance, to which he is
    unaccustomed—through latitudes and longitudes which are new to
    him—living on food that he is unused to—stared and gazed at by the
    thousands and tens of thousands whom he cannot talk to—his heart
    grieving and his body sickening at the exhibition of white men’s wealth
    and luxuries, which are enjoyed on the land, and over the bones of
    his ancestors. And at the end of his journey he stands (like a caged
    animal) to be scanned—to be criticised—to be pitied—and heralded to the
    world as a mute—as a brute, and a beggar.</p>

  <p>A white man, to reach this village, must travel by steam-boat—by
    canoes—on horseback and on foot; swim rivers—wade quagmires—fight
    mosquitoes—patch his moccasins, and patch them again and again, and his
    breeches; live on meat alone—sleep on the ground the whole way, and
    think and dream of his friends he has left behind; and when he gets
    here, half-starved, and half-naked, and more than half sick, he finds
    himself a beggar for a place to sleep, and for something to eat; a
    mute amongst thousands who flock about him, to look and to criticise,
    and to laugh at him for his jaded appearance, and to speak of him as
    they do of all white men (without distinction) as liars. These people
    are in the habit of seeing no white men in their country but Traders,
    and know of no other; deeming us all alike, and receiving us all under
    the presumption that we come to trade or barter; applying to us all,
    indiscriminately, the epithet of “liars” or Traders.</p>

  <p>The reader will therefore see, that we mutually suffer in each other’s
    estimation from the unfortunate ignorance, which distance has chained
    us in; and (as I can vouch, and the Indian also, who has visited
    the civilized world) that the historian who would record justly and
    correctly the character and customs of a people, must go and live among
    them.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MANDAN VILLAGE, UPPER MISSOURI.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">In</span> my last, I gave some account of the village, and the customs, and
    appearances of this strange people,—and I will now proceed to give
    further details on that subject.</p>

  <p>I have this morning, perched myself upon the top of one of the
    earth-covered lodges, which I have before described, and having the
    whole village beneath and about me (<a href="#i_047"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 47</a>), with its
    sachems—its warriors—its dogs—and its horses in motion—its medicines
    (or mysteries) and scalp-poles waving over my head—its piquets—its
    green fields and prairies, and river in full view, with the din and
    bustle of the thrilling panorama that is about me. I shall be able, I
    hope, to give some sketches more to the life than I could have done
    from any effort of recollection.</p>

  <p>I said that the lodges or wigwams were covered with earth—were of forty
    or sixty feet in diameter, and so closely grouped that there was but
    just room enough to walk and ride between them,—that they had a door by
    which to enter them, and a hole in the top for the admission of light,
    and for the smoke to escape,—that the inmates were at times grouped
    upon their tops in conversations and other amusements, &amp;c.; and yet
    you know not exactly how they look, nor what is the precise appearance
    of the strange world that is about me. There is really a newness
    and rudeness in every thing that is to be seen. There are several
    hundred houses or dwellings about me, and they are purely unique—they
    are all covered with dirt—the people are all red, and yet distinct
    from all other red folks I have seen. The horses are wild—every dog
    is a wolf—the whole moving mass are strangers to me: the living, in
    everything, carry an air of intractable wildness about them, and the
    dead are not buried, but dried upon scaffolds.</p>

  <p>The groups of lodges around me present a very curious and pleasing
    appearance, resembling in shape (more nearly than anything else I
    can compare them to) so many potash-kettles inverted. On the tops
    of these are to be seen groups standing and reclining, whose wild
    and picturesque appearance it would be difficult to describe. Stern
    warriors, like statues, standing in dignified groups, wrapped in their
    painted robes, with their heads decked and plumed with quills of the
    war-eagle; extending their long arms to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span> the east or the west, the
    scenes of their battles, which they are recounting over to each other.
    In another direction, the wooing lover, softening the heart of his fair
    Taih-nah-tai-a with the notes of his simple lute. On other lodges, and
    beyond these, groups are engaged in games of the “moccasin,” or the
    “platter.” Some are to be seen manufacturing robes and dresses, and
    others, fatigued with amusements or occupations, have stretched their
    limbs to enjoy the luxury of sleep, whilst basking in the sun. With
    all this wild and varied medley of living beings are mixed their dogs,
    which seem to be so near an Indian’s heart, as almost to constitute a
    material link of his existence.</p>

  <p>In the centre of the village is an open space, or public area, of 150
    feet in diameter, and circular in form, which is used for all public
    games and festivals, shews and exhibitions; and also for their “annual
    religious ceremonies,” which are soon to take place, and of which I
    shall hereafter give some account. The lodges around this open space
    front in, with their doors towards the centre; and in the middle of
    this circle stands an object of great religious veneration, as I am
    told, on account of the importance it has in the conduction of those
    annual religious rites.</p>

  <p>This object is in form of a large hogshead, some eight or ten feet
    high, made of planks and hoops, containing within it some of their
    choicest medicines or mysteries, and religiously preserved unhacked or
    scratched, as a symbol of the “Big Canoe,” as they call it.</p>

  <p>One of the lodges fronting on this circular area, and facing this
    strange object of their superstition, is called the “Medicine Lodge,”
    or council house. It is in this sacred building that these wonderful
    ceremonies, in commemoration of the flood, take place. I am told by the
    Traders that the cruelties of these scenes are frightful and abhorrent
    in the extreme; and that this huge wigwam, which is now closed, has
    been built exclusively for this grand celebration. I am every day
    reminded of the near approach of the season for this strange affair,
    and as I have not yet seen any thing of it, I cannot describe it; I
    know it only from the relations of the Traders who have witnessed parts
    of it; and their descriptions are of so extraordinary a character, that
    I would not be willing to describe until I can see for myself,—which
    will, in all probability, be in a few days.</p>

  <p>In ranging the eye over the village from where I am writing, there
    is presented to the view the strangest mixture and medley of
    unintelligible trash (independent of the living beings that are in
    motion), that can possibly be imagined. On the roofs of the lodges,
    besides the groups of living, are buffaloes’ skulls, skin canoes,
    pots and pottery; sleds and sledges—and suspended on poles, erected
    some twenty feet above the doors of their wigwams, are displayed in a
    pleasant day, the scalps of warriors, preserved as trophies; and thus
    proudly exposed as evidence of their warlike deeds. In other parts are
    raised on poles the warriors’ pure and whitened shields and quivers,
    with medicine-bags attached; and here and there a sacrifice of red
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>cloth, or other costly stuff, offered up to the Great Spirit, over
    the door of some benignant chief, in humble gratitude for the blessings
    which he is enjoying. Such is a part of the strange medley that is
    before and around me; and amidst them and the blue streams of smoke
    that are rising from the tops of these hundred “coal-pits,” can be
    seen in distance, the green and boundless, treeless, bushless prairie;
    and on it, and contiguous to the piquet which encloses the village, a
    hundred scaffolds on which their “dead live,” as they term it.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>26</i></div>
  <figure id="i_047">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_047.jpg" alt="" />

    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_048.jpg" alt="" />

  </figure>

  <p>These people never bury the dead, but place the bodies on slight
    scaffolds just above the reach of human hands, and out of the way of
    wolves and dogs; and they are there left to moulder and decay. This
    cemetery, or place of deposite for the dead, is just back of the
    village, on a level prairie (<a href="#i_048"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 48</a>); and with all its
    appearances, history, forms, ceremonies, &amp;c. is one of the strangest
    and most interesting objects to be described in the vicinity of this
    peculiar race.</p>

  <p>Whenever a person dies in the Mandan village, and the customary honours
    and condolence are paid to his remains, and the body dressed in its
    best attire, painted, oiled, feasted, and supplied with bow and quiver,
    shield, pipe and tobacco—knife, flint and steel, and provisions enough
    to last him a few days on the journey which he is to perform; a fresh
    buffalo’s skin, just taken from the animal’s back, is wrapped around
    the body, and tightly bound and wound with thongs of raw hide from head
    to foot. Then other robes are soaked in water, till they are quite
    soft and elastic, which are also bandaged around the body in the same
    manner, and tied fast with thongs, which are wound with great care and
    exactness, so as to exclude the action of the air from all parts of the
    body.</p>

  <p>There is then a separate scaffold erected for it, constructed of four
    upright posts, a little higher than human hands can reach; and on the
    tops of these are small poles passing around from one post to the
    others; across which a number of willow-rods just strong enough to
    support the body, which is laid upon them on its back, with its feet
    carefully presented towards the rising sun.</p>

  <p>There are a great number of these bodies resting exactly in a similar
    way; excepting in some instances where a chief, or medicine-man, may
    be seen with a few yards of scarlet or blue cloth spread over his
    remains, as a mark of public respect and esteem. Some hundreds of these
    bodies may be seen reposing in this manner in this curious place, which
    the Indians call, “the village of the dead;” and the traveller, who
    visits this country to study and learn, will not only be struck with
    the novel appearance of the scene; but if he will give attention to
    the respect and devotions that are paid to this sacred place, he will
    draw many a moral deduction that will last him through life: he will
    learn, at least, that filial, conjugal, and paternal affection are not
    necessarily the results of civilization; but that the Great Spirit
    has given them to man in his native state; and that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span> spices and
    improvements of the enlightened world have never refined upon them.</p>

  <p>There is not a day in the year in which one may not see in this place
    evidences of this fact, that will wring tears from his eyes, and kindle
    in his bosom a spark of respect and sympathy for the poor Indian, if
    he never felt it before. Fathers, mothers, wives, and children, may
    be seen lying under these scaffolds, prostrated upon the ground, with
    their faces in the dirt, howling forth incessantly the most piteous
    and heart-broken cries and lamentations for the misfortunes of their
    kindred; tearing their hair—cutting their flesh with their knives,
    and doing other penance to appease the spirits of the dead, whose
    misfortunes they attribute to some sin or omission of their own, for
    which they sometimes inflict the most excruciating self-torture.</p>

  <p>When the scaffolds on which the bodies rest, decay and fall to the
    ground, the nearest relations having buried the rest of the bones,
    take the skulls, which are perfectly bleached and purified, and place
    them in circles of an hundred or more on the prairie—placed at equal
    distances apart (some eight or nine inches from each other), with the
    faces all looking to the centre; where they are religiously protected
    and preserved in their precise positions from year to year, as objects
    of religious and affectionate veneration (<a href="#i_048"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 48</a>).</p>

  <p>There are several of these “Golgothas” or circles of twenty or thirty
    feet in diameter, and in the centre of each ring or circle is a
    little mound of three feet high, on which uniformly rest two buffalo
    skulls (a male and female); and in the centre of the little mound is
    erected a “medicine pole,” about twenty feet high, supporting many
    curious articles of mystery and superstition, which they suppose have
    the power of guarding and protecting this sacred arrangement. Here
    then, to this strange place do these people again resort, to evince
    their further affections for the dead—not in groans and lamentations
    however, for several years have cured the anguish; but fond affections
    and endearments are here renewed, and conversations are here held and
    cherished with the dead.</p>

  <p>Each one of these skulls is placed upon a bunch of wild sage, which
    has been pulled and placed under it. The wife knows (by some mark or
    resemblance) the skull of her husband or her child, which lies in this
    group; and there seldom passes a day that she does not visit it, with
    a dish of the best cooked food that her wigwam affords, which she sets
    before the skull at night, and returns for the dish in the morning.
    As soon as it is discovered that the sage on which the skull rests is
    beginning to decay, the woman cuts a fresh bunch, and places the skull
    carefully upon it, removing that which was under it.</p>

  <p>Independent of the above-named duties, which draw the women to this
    spot, they visit it from inclination, and linger upon it to hold
    converse and company with the dead. There is scarcely an hour in a
    pleasant day, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span> more or less of these women may be seen sitting or
    laying by the skull of their child or husband—talking to it in the most
    pleasant and endearing language that they can use (as they were wont
    to do in former days) and seemingly getting an answer back. It is not
    unfrequently the case, that the woman brings her needle-work with her,
    spending the greater part of the day, sitting by the side of the skull
    of her child, chatting incessantly with it, while she is embroidering
    or garnishing a pair of moccasins; and perhaps, overcome with fatigue,
    falls asleep, with her arms encircled around it, forgetting herself for
    hours; after which she gathers up her things and returns to the village.</p>

  <p>There is something exceedingly interesting and impressive in these
    scenes, which are so strikingly dissimilar, and yet within a few rods
    of each other; the one is the place where they pour forth the frantic
    anguish of their souls—and afterwards pay their visits to the other, to
    jest and gossip with the dead.</p>

  <p>The great variety of shapes and characters exhibited in these groups
    of crania, render them a very interesting study for the craniologist
    and phrenologist; but I apprehend that it would be a matter of great
    difficulty (if not of impossibility) to procure them at this time, for
    the use and benefit of the scientific world.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MANDAN VILLAGE, UPPER MISSOURI.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">In</span> several of my former Letters I have given sketches of the village,
    and some few of the customs of these peculiar people; and I have many
    more yet in store; some of which will induce the readers to laugh, and
    others almost dispose them to weep. But at present, I drop them, and
    introduce a few of the wild and gentlemanly Mandans themselves; and
    first, Ha-na-tah-nu-mauh, the wolf chief (<a href="#i_049"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 49</a>). This
    man is head-chief of the nation, and familiarly known by the name of
    “Chef de Loup,” as the French Traders call him; a haughty, austere, and
    overbearing man, respected and feared by his people rather than loved.
    The tenure by which this man holds his office, is that by which the
    head-chiefs of most of the tribes claim, that of inheritance. It is
    a general, though not an infallible rule amongst the numerous tribes
    of North American Indians, that the office of chief belongs to the
    eldest son of a chief; provided he shews himself, by his conduct, to be
    equally worthy of it as any other in the nation: making it hereditary
    on a very proper condition—in default of which requisites, or others
    which may happen, the office is elective.</p>

  <p>The dress of this chief was one of great extravagance, and some beauty;
    manufactured of skins, and a great number of quills of the raven,
    forming his stylish head-dress.</p>

  <p>The next and second chief of the tribe, is Mah-to-toh-pa (the four
    bears). This extraordinary man, though second in office is undoubtedly
    the first and most popular man in the nation. Free, generous, elegant
    and gentlemanly in his deportment—handsome, brave and valiant; wearing
    a robe on his back, with the history of his battles emblazoned on it;
    which would fill a book of themselves, if properly translated. This,
    readers, is the most extraordinary man, perhaps, who lives at this day,
    in the atmosphere of Nature’s noblemen; and I shall certainly tell you
    more of him anon.</p>

  <p>After him, there are Mah-tahp-ta-ha, he who rushes through the
    middle (<a href="#i_050"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 50</a>); Seehk-hee-da, the mouse-coloured
    feather (<a href="#i_050"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 51</a>); San-ja-ka-ko-kah (the deceiving wolf);
    Mah-to-he-ha (the old bear), and others, distinguished as chiefs and
    warriors—and there are belles also; such as Mi-neek-e-sunk-te-ca, the
    mink (<a href="#i_052"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 53</a>); and the little gray-haired Sha-ko-ka, mint
    (<a href="#i_052"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 52</a>); and fifty others, who are famous for
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>their
    conquests, not with the bow or the javelin, but with their small black
    eyes, which shoot out from under their unfledged brows, and pierce the
    boldest, fiercest chieftain to the heart.</p>

  <p>The Mandans are certainly a very interesting and pleasing people in
    their personal appearance and manners; differing in many respects, both
    in looks and customs, from all other tribes which I have seen. They
    are not a warlike people; for they seldom, if ever, carry war into
    their enemies’ country; but when invaded, shew their valour and courage
    to be equal to that of any people on earth. Being a small tribe, and
    unable to contend on the wide prairies with the Sioux and other roaming
    tribes, who are ten times more numerous; they have very judiciously
    located themselves in a permanent village, which is strongly fortified,
    and ensures their preservation. By this means they have advanced
    further in the arts of manufacture; have supplied their lodges more
    abundantly with the comforts, and even luxuries of life, than any
    Indian nation I know of. The consequence of this is, that this tribe
    have taken many steps ahead of other tribes in manners and refinements
    (if I may be allowed to apply the word refinement to Indian life); and
    are therefore familiarly (and correctly) denominated, by the Traders
    and others, who have been amongst them, “the polite and friendly
    Mandans.”</p>

  <p>There is certainly great justice in the remark; and so forcibly have
    I been struck with the peculiar ease and elegance of these people,
    together with the diversity of complexions, the various colours of
    their hair and eyes; the singularity of their language, and their
    peculiar and unaccountable customs, that I am fully convinced that
    they have sprung from some other origin than that of the other North
    American tribes, or that they are an amalgam of natives with some
    civilized race.</p>

  <p>Here arises a question of very great interest and importance for
    discussion; and, after further familiarity with their character,
    customs, and traditions, if I forget it not, I will eventually give it
    further consideration. Suffice it then, for the present, that their
    <em>personal appearance</em> alone, independent of their modes and
    customs, pronounces them at once, as more or less, than savage.</p>

  <p>A stranger in the Mandan village is first struck with the different
    shades of complexion, and various colours of hair which he sees in a
    crowd about him; and is at once almost disposed to exclaim that “these
    are not Indians.”</p>

  <p>There are a great many of these people whose complexions appear as
    light as half breeds; and amongst the women particularly, there are
    many whose skins are almost white, with the most pleasing symmetry
    and proportion of features; with hazel, with grey, and with blue
    eyes,—with mildness and sweetness of expression, and excessive modesty
    of demeanour, which render them exceedingly pleasing and beautiful.</p>

  <p>Why this diversity of complexion I cannot tell, nor can they
    themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> account for it. Their traditions, so far as I have yet
    learned them, afford us no information of their having had any
    knowledge of white men before the visit of Lewis and Clarke, made to
    their village thirty-three years ago. Since that time there have been
    but very few visits from white men to this place, and surely not enough
    to have changed the complexions and the customs of a nation. And I
    recollect perfectly well that Governor Clarke told me, before I started
    for this place, that I would find the Mandans a strange people and half
    white.</p>

  <p>The diversity in the colour of hair is also equally as great as that
    in the complexion; for in a numerous group of these people (and more
    particularly amongst the females, who never take pains to change its
    natural colour, as the men often do), there may be seen every shade and
    colour of hair that can be seen in our own country, with the exception
    of red or auburn, which is not to be found.</p>

  <p>And there is yet one more strange and unaccountable peculiarity, which
    can probably be seen nowhere else on earth; nor on any rational grounds
    accounted for,—other than it is a freak or order of Nature, for which
    she has not seen fit to assign a reason. There are very many, of both
    sexes, and of every age, from infancy to manhood and old age, with hair
    of a bright silvery grey; and in some instances almost perfectly white.</p>

  <p>This singular and eccentric appearance is much oftener seen among the
    women than it is with the men; for many of the latter who have it,
    seem ashamed of it, and artfully conceal it, by filling their hair
    with glue and black and red earth. The women, on the other hand, seem
    proud of it, and display it often in an almost incredible profusion,
    which spreads over their shoulders and falls as low as the knee. I have
    ascertained, on a careful enquiry, that about one in ten or twelve of
    the whole tribe are what the French call “cheveux gris,” or greyhairs;
    and that this strange and unaccountable phenomenon is not the result of
    disease or habit; but that it is unquestionably a hereditary character
    which runs in families, and indicates no inequality in disposition or
    intellect. And by passing this hair through my hands, as I often have,
    I have found it uniformly to be as coarse and harsh as a horse’s mane;
    differing materially from the hair of other colours, which amongst the
    Mandans, is generally as fine and as soft as silk.</p>

  <p>The reader will at once see, by the above facts, that there is enough
    upon the faces and heads of these people to stamp them peculiar,—when
    he meets them in the heart of this almost boundless wilderness,
    presenting such diversities of colour in the complexion and hair; when
    he knows from what he has seen, and what he has read, that all other
    primitive tribes known in America, are dark copper-coloured, with jet
    black hair.</p>

  <p>From these few facts alone, the reader will see that I am amongst a
    strange and interesting people, and know how to pardon me, if I lead
    him through a maze of novelty and mysteries to the knowledge of a
    strange, yet kind and hospitable, people, whose fate, like that of all
    their race is sealed;—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span> whose doom is fixed, to live just long enough
    to be imperfectly known, and then to fall before the fell disease or
    sword of civilizing devastation.</p>

  <p>The stature of the Mandans is rather below the ordinary size of
    man, with beautiful symmetry of form and proportion, and wonderful
    suppleness and elasticity; they are pleasingly erect and graceful,
    both in their walk and their attitudes; and the hair of the men,
    which generally spreads over their backs, falling down to the hams,
    and sometimes to the ground, is divided into plaits or slabs of two
    inches in width, and filled with a profusion of glue and red earth or
    vermilion, at intervals of an inch or two, which becoming very hard,
    remains in and unchanged from year to year.</p>

  <p>This mode of dressing the hair is curious, and gives to the Mandans the
    most singular appearance. The hair of the men is uniformly all laid
    over from the forehead backwards; carefully kept above and resting on
    the ear, and thence falling down over the back, in these flattened
    bunches, and painted red, extending oftentimes quite on to the calf
    of the leg, and sometimes in such profusion as almost to conceal the
    whole figure from the person walking behind them. In the portrait of
    San-ja-ka-ko-kah (the deceiving wolf, <a href="#i_054"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 54</a>), where he is
    represented at full length, with several others of his family around
    him in a group, there will be seen a fair illustration of these and
    other customs of these people.</p>

  <p>The hair of the women is also worn as long as they can possibly
    cultivate it, oiled very often, which preserves on it a beautiful gloss
    and shows its natural colour. They often braid it in two large plaits,
    one falling down just back of the ear, on each side of the head; and
    on any occasion which requires them to “put on their best looks,” they
    pass their fingers through it, drawing it out of braid, and spreading
    it over their shoulders. The Mandan women observe strictly the same
    custom, which I observed amongst the Crows and Blackfeet (and, in fact,
    all other tribes I have seen, without a single exception), of parting
    the hair on the forehead, and always keeping the crease or separation
    filled with vermilion or other red paint. This is one of the very few
    little (and apparently trivial) customs which I have found amongst the
    Indians, without being able to assign any cause for it, other than that
    “they are Indians,” and that this is an Indian fashion.</p>

  <p>In mourning, like the Crows and most other tribes the women are obliged
    to crop their hair all off; and the usual term of that condolence is
    until the hair has grown again to its former length.</p>

  <p>When a man mourns for the death of a near relation the case is quite
    different; his long, valued tresses, are of much greater importance,
    and only a lock or two can be spared. Just enough to tell of his grief
    to his friends, without destroying his most valued ornament, is doing
    just reverence and respect to the dead.</p>

  <p>To repeat what I have said before, the Mandans are a pleasing and
    friendly race of people, of whom it is proverbial amongst the Traders
    and all who ever have known them that their treatment of white men
    in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> country has been friendly and kind ever since their first
    acquaintance with them—they have ever met and received them, on the
    prairie or in their villages, with hospitality and honour.</p>

  <p>They are handsome, straight and elegant in their forms—not tall,
    but quick and graceful; easy and polite in their manners, neat in
    their persons and beautifully clad. When I say “neat in person and
    beautifully clad,” however, I do not intend my readers to understand
    that such is the case with them all, for among them and most other
    tribes, as with the enlightened world, there are different grades of
    society—those who care but little for their personal appearance, and
    those who take great pains to please themselves and their friends.
    Amongst this class of personages, such as chiefs and braves, or
    warriors of distinction, and their families, and dandies or exquisites
    (a class of beings of whom I shall take due time to speak in a future
    Letter), the strictest regard to decency, and cleanliness and elegance
    of dress is observed; and there are few people, perhaps, who take more
    pains to keep their persons neat and cleanly than they do.</p>

  <p>At the distance of half a mile or so above the village, is the
    customary place where the women and girls resort every morning in the
    summer months, to bathe in the river. To this spot they repair by
    hundreds, every morning at sunrise, where, on a beautiful beach, they
    can be seen running and glistening in the sun, whilst they are playing
    their innocent gambols and leaping into the stream. They all learn to
    swim well, and the poorest swimmer amongst them will dash fearlessly
    into the boiling and eddying current of the Missouri, and cross it with
    perfect ease. At the distance of a quarter of a mile back from the
    river, extends a terrace or elevated prairie, running north from the
    village, and forming a kind of semi-circle around this bathing-place;
    and on this terrace, which is some twenty or thirty feet higher than
    the meadow between it and the river, are stationed every morning
    several sentinels, with their bows and arrows in hand, to guard and
    protect this sacred ground from the approach of boys or men from any
    directions.</p>

  <p>At a little distance below the village, also, is the place where
    the men and boys go to bathe and learn to swim. After this morning
    ablution, they return to their village, wipe their limbs dry, and use a
    profusion of bear’s grease through their hair and over their bodies.</p>

  <p>The art of swimming is known to all the American Indians; and perhaps
    no people on earth have taken more pains to learn it, nor any who turn
    it to better account. There certainly are no people whose avocations
    of life more often call for the use of their limbs in this way; as
    many of the tribes spend their lives on the shores of our vast lakes
    and rivers, paddling about from their childhood in their fragile bark
    canoes, which are liable to continual accidents, which often throw the
    Indian upon his natural resources for the preservation of his life.</p>

  <p>There are many times also, when out upon their long marches in the
    prosecution of their almost continued warfare, when it becomes
    necessary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span> plunge into and swim across the wildest streams and
    rivers, at times when they have no canoes or craft in which to cross
    them. I have as yet seen no tribe where this art is neglected. It is
    learned at a very early age by both sexes, and enables the strong and
    hardy muscles of the squaws to take their child upon the back, and
    successfully to pass any river that lies in their way.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>29</i></div>
  <figure id="i_054">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_054.jpg" alt="" />
     <figcaption>54</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The mode of swimming amongst the Mandans, as well as amongst most of
    the other tribes, is quite different from that practiced in those parts
    of the civilized world, which I have had the pleasure yet to visit. The
    Indian, instead of parting his hands simultaneously under the chin, and
    making the stroke outward, in a horizontal direction, causing thereby
    a serious strain upon the chest, throws his body alternately upon the
    left and the right side, raising one arm entirely above the water and
    reaching as far forward as he can, to dip it, whilst his whole weight
    and force are spent upon the one that is passing under him, and like a
    paddle propelling him along; whilst this arm is making a half circle,
    and is being raised out of the water behind him, the opposite arm is
    describing a similar arch in the air over his head, to be dipped in the
    water as far as he can reach before him, with the hand turned under,
    forming a sort of bucket, to act most effectively as it passes in its
    turn underneath him.</p>

  <p>By this bold and powerful mode of swimming, which may want the grace
    that many would wish to see, I am quite sure, from the experience I
    have had, that much of the fatigue and strain upon the breast and spine
    are avoided, and that a man will preserve his strength and his breath
    much longer in this alternate and rolling motion, than he can in the
    usual mode of swimming, in the polished world.</p>

  <p>In addition to the modes of bathing which I have above described,
    the Mandans have another, which is a much greater luxury, and often
    resorted to by the sick, but far more often by the well and sound, as
    a matter of luxury only, or perhaps for the purpose of hardening their
    limbs and preparing them for the thousand exposures and vicissitudes
    of life to which they are continually liable. I allude to their vapour
    baths, or <em>sudatories</em>, of which each village has several, and
    which seem to be a kind of public property—accessible to all, and
    resorted to by all, male and female, old and young, sick and well.</p>

  <p>In every Mandan lodge is to be seen a crib or basket, much in the shape
    of a bathing-tub, curiously woven with willow boughs, and sufficiently
    large to receive any person of the family in a reclining or recumbent
    posture; which, when any one is to take a bath, is carried by the squaw
    to the sudatory for the purpose, and brought back to the wigwam again
    after it has been used.</p>

  <p>These sudatories are always near the village, above or below it, on
    the bank of the river. They are generally built of skins (in form of
    a Crow or Sioux lodge which I have before described), covered with
    buffalo skins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span> sewed tight together, with a kind of furnace in the
    centre; or in other words, in the centre of the lodge are two walls of
    stone about six feet long and two and a half apart, and about three
    feet high; across and over this space, between the two walls, are laid
    a number of round sticks, on which the bathing crib is placed (vide
    <a href="#i_071"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 71</a>). Contiguous to the lodge, and outside of it, is a
    little furnace something similar, in the side of the bank, where the
    woman kindles a hot fire, and heats to a red heat a number of large
    stones, which are kept at these places for this particular purpose; and
    having them all in readiness, she goes home or sends word to inform her
    husband or other one who is waiting, that all is ready; when he makes
    his appearance entirely naked, though with a large buffalo robe wrapped
    around him. He then enters the lodge and places himself in the crib or
    basket, either on his back or in a sitting posture (the latter of which
    is generally preferred), with his back towards the door of the lodge;
    when the squaw brings in a large stone red hot, between two sticks
    (lashed together somewhat in the form of a pair of tongs) and, placing
    it under him, throws cold water upon it, which raises a profusion of
    vapour about him. He is at once enveloped in a cloud of steam, and a
    woman or child will sit at a little distance and continue to dash water
    upon the stone, whilst the matron of the lodge is out, and preparing to
    make her appearance with another heated stone: or he will sit and dip
    from a wooden bowl, with a ladle made of the mountain-sheep’s horn, and
    throw upon the heated stones, with his own hands, the water which he is
    drawing through his lungs and pores, in the next moment, in the most
    delectable and exhilarating vapours, as it distils through the mat of
    wild sage and other medicinal and aromatic herbs, which he has strewed
    over the bottom of his basket, and on which he reclines.</p>

  <p>During all this time the lodge is shut perfectly tight, and he quaffs
    this delicious and renovating draught to his lungs with deep drawn
    sighs, and with extended nostrils, until he is drenched in the most
    profuse degree of perspiration that can be produced; when he makes a
    kind of strangled signal, at which the lodge is opened, and he darts
    forth with the speed of a frightened deer, and plunges headlong into
    the river, from which he instantly escapes again, wraps his robe around
    him and “leans” as fast as possible for home. Here his limbs are wiped
    dry, and wrapped close and tight within the fur of the buffalo robes,
    in which he takes his nap, with his feet to the fire; then oils his
    limbs and hair with bear’s grease, dresses and plumes himself for a
    visit—a feast—a parade, or a council; or slicks down his long hair,
    and rubs his oiled limbs to a polish, with a piece of soft buckskin,
    prepared to join in games of bail or Tchung-kee.</p>

  <p>Such is the sudatory or the vapour bath of the Mandans, and as I before
    observed, it is resorted to both as an every-day luxury by those who
    have the time and energy or industry to indulge in it; and also used
    by the sick as a remedy for nearly all the diseases which are known
    amongst them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span> Fevers are very rare, and in fact almost unknown amongst
    these people: but in the few cases of fever which have been known, this
    treatment has been applied, and without the fatal consequences which
    we would naturally predict. The greater part of their diseases are
    inflammatory rheumatisms, and other chronic diseases; and for these,
    this mode of treatment, with their modes of life, does admirably well.
    This custom is similar amongst nearly all of these Missouri Indians,
    and amongst the Pawnees, Omahas, and Punchas and other tribes, who have
    suffered with the small-pox (the dread destroyer of the Indian race),
    this mode was practiced by the poor creatures, who fled by hundreds
    to the river’s edge, and by hundreds died before they could escape
    from the waves, into which they had plunged in the heat and rage of a
    burning fever. Such will yet be the scourge, and such the misery of
    these poor unthinking people, and each tribe to the Rocky Mountains,
    as it has been with every tribe between here and the Atlantic
    Ocean. White men—whiskey—tomahawks—scalping knives—guns, powder and
    ball—small-pox—debauchery—extermination.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MANDAN VILLAGE, UPPER MISSOURI.</div>

  <p>The Mandans in many instances dress very neatly, and some of them
    splendidly. As they are in their native state, their dresses are all
    of their own manufacture; and of course, altogether made of skins of
    different animals belonging to those regions. There is, certainly,
    a reigning and striking similarity of costume amongst most of the
    North Western tribes; and I cannot say that the dress of the Mandans
    is decidedly distinct from that of the Crows or the Blackfeet, the
    Assinneboins or the Sioux; yet there are modes of stitching or
    embroidering, in every tribe, which may at once enable the traveller,
    who is familiar with their modes, to detect or distinguish the dress
    of any tribe. These differences consist generally in the fashions of
    constructing the head-dress, or of garnishing their dresses with the
    porcupine quills, which they use in great profusion.</p>

  <p>Amongst so many different and distinct nations, always at war with
    each other, and knowing nothing at all of each other’s languages; and
    amongst whom, fashions in dress seldom if ever change; it may seem
    somewhat strange that we should find these people so nearly following,
    or imitating each other, in the forms and modes of their dress and
    ornaments. This must however, be admitted, and I think may be accounted
    for in a manner, without raising the least argument in favour of the
    theory of their having all sprung from one stock or one family; for in
    their continual warfare, when chiefs or warriors fall, their clothes
    and weapons usually fall into the possession of the victors, who wear
    them; and the rest of the tribe would naturally more or less often
    copy from or imitate them; and so also in their repeated councils or
    treaties of peace, such articles of dress and other manufactures are
    customarily exchanged, which are equally adopted by the other tribe;
    and consequently, eventually lead to the similarity which we find
    amongst the modes of dress, &amp;c. of the different tribes.</p>

  <p>The tunic or shirt of the Mandan men is very similar in shape to that
    of the Blackfeet—made of two skins of deer or mountain-sheep, strung
    with scalp-locks, beads, and ermine. The leggings, like those of the
    other tribes, of whom I have spoken, are made of deer skins, and shaped
    to fit the leg, embroidered with porcupine quills, and fringed with
    scalps from their enemies heads. Their moccasins are made of buckskin,
    and neatly ornamented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span> with porcupine quills—over their shoulders (or
    in other words, over one shoulder and passing under the other), they
    very gracefully wear a robe from the young buffalo’s back, oftentimes
    cut down to about half its original size, to make it handy and easy
    for use. Many of these are also fringed on one side with scalp-locks;
    and the flesh side of the skin curiously ornamented with pictured
    representations of the creditable events and battles of their lives.</p>

  <p>Their head-dresses are of various sorts, and many of them exceedingly
    picturesque and handsome; generally made of war-eagles’ or ravens
    quills and ermine. These are the most costly part of an Indian’s dress
    in all this country, owing to the difficulty of procuring the quills
    and the fur. The war-eagle being the “<i>rara avis</i>,” and the ermine
    the rarest animal that is found in the country. The tail of a war-eagle
    in this village, provided it is a perfect one, containing some six or
    eight quills, which are denominated first-rate plumes, and suitable to
    arrange in a head-dress, will purchase a tolerable good horse (horses,
    however, are much cheaper here than they are in most other countries).
    I have had abundant opportunities of learning the great value which
    these people sometimes attach to such articles of dress and ornament,
    as I have been purchasing a great many, which I intend to exhibit in
    my Gallery of Indian Paintings, that the world may examine them for
    themselves, and thereby be enabled to judge of the fidelity of my
    works, and the ingenuity of Indian manufactures.</p>

  <p>In these purchases I have often been surprised at the prices demanded
    by them; and perhaps I could not recite a better instance of the kind,
    than one which occurred here a few days since:—One of the chiefs, whom
    I had painted at full length, in a beautiful costume, with head-dress
    of war-eagles’ quills and ermine, extending quite down to his feet;
    and whom I was soliciting for the purchase of his dress complete, was
    willing to sell to me all but the head-dress; saying, that “he could
    not part with that, as he would never be able to get quills and ermine
    of so good a quality to make another like it.” I agreed with him,
    however, for the rest of the dress, and importuned him, from day to
    day, for the head-dress, until he at length replied, that, if I must
    have it, he must have two horses for it; the bargain was instantly
    struck—the horses were procured of the Traders at twenty-five dollars
    each, and the head-dress secured for my Collection.</p>

  <p>There is occasionally, a chief or a warrior of so extraordinary renown,
    that he is allowed to wear horns on his head-dress, which give to his
    aspect a strange and majestic effect. These are made of about a third
    part of the horn of a buffalo bull; the horn having been split from end
    to end, and a third part of it taken and shaved thin and light, and
    highly polished. These are attached to the top of the head-dress on
    each side, in the same place that they rise and stand on the head of
    a buffalo; rising out of a mat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> of ermine skins and tails, which hang
    over the top of the head-dress, somewhat in the form that the large and
    profuse locks of hair hang and fall over the head of a buffalo bull.
    See head-dress in <span class="smcap">plates</span> <a href="#i_014">14</a>, <a href="#i_064">64</a>, and <a href="#i_091">91</a>, of three different
    tribes.</p>

  <p>The same custom I have found observed amongst the Sioux,—the Crows—the
    Blackfeet and Assinneboins, and it is one of so striking a character
    as needs a few more words of observation. There is a peculiar meaning
    or importance (in their estimation) to this and many other curious and
    unaccountable appearances in the habits of Indians, upon which the
    world generally look as things that are absurd and ridiculous, merely
    because they are beyond the world’s comprehension, or because we do not
    stop to enquire or learn their uses or meaning.</p>

  <p>I find that the principal cause why we underrate and despise the
    savage, is generally because we do not understand him; and the reason
    why we are ignorant of him and his modes, is that we do not stop to
    investigate—the world have been too much in the habit of looking
    upon him as altogether inferior—as a beast, a brute; and unworthy
    of more than a passing notice. If they stop long enough to form
    an acquaintance, it is but to take advantage of his ignorance and
    credulities—to rob him of the wealth and resources of his country;—to
    make him drunk with whiskey, and visit him with abuses which in his
    ignorance he never thought of. By this method his first visitors
    entirely overlook and never understand the meaning of his thousand
    interesting and characteristic customs; and at the same time, by
    changing his native modes and habits of life, blot them out from the
    view of the enquiring world for ever.</p>

  <p>It is from the observance of a thousand little and apparently trivial
    modes and tricks of Indian life, that the Indian character must be
    learned; and, in fact, it is just the same with us if the subject were
    reversed: excepting that the system of civilized life would furnish
    ten apparently useless and ridiculous trifles to one which is found in
    Indian life; and at least twenty to one which are purely nonsensical
    and unmeaning.</p>

  <p>The civilized world look upon a group of Indians, in their classic
    dress, with their few and simple oddities, all of which have their
    moral or meaning, and laugh at them excessively, because they are not
    like ourselves—we ask, “why do the silly creatures wear such great
    bunches of quills on their heads?—Such loads and streaks of paint upon
    their bodies—and bear’s grease? abominable!” and a thousand other
    equally silly questions, without ever stopping to think that Nature
    taught them to do so—and that they all have some definite importance
    or meaning which an Indian could explain to us at once, if he were
    asked and felt disposed to do so—that each quill in his head stood,
    in the eyes of his whole tribe, as the symbol of an enemy who had
    fallen by his hand—that every streak of red paint covered a wound
    which he had got in honourable combat—and that the bear’s grease with
    which he carefully anoints his body every morning, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span> head to foot,
    cleanses and purifies the body, and protects his skin from the bite of
    mosquitoes, and at the same time preserves him from colds and coughs
    which are usually taken through the pores of the skin.</p>

  <p>At the same time, an Indian looks among the civilized world, no doubt,
    with equal, if not much greater, astonishment, at our apparently, as
    well as <em>really</em>, ridiculous customs and fashions; but he laughs
    not, nor ridicules, nor questions,—for his natural good sense and good
    manners forbid him,—until he is reclining about the fire-side of his
    wigwam companions, when he vents forth his just criticisms upon the
    learned world, who are a rich and just theme for Indian criticism and
    Indian gossip.</p>

  <p>An Indian will not ask a white man the reason why he does not oil his
    skin with bears’ grease, or why he does not paint his body—or why he
    wears a hat on his head, or why he has buttons on the back part of
    his coat, where they never can be used—or why he wears whiskers, and
    a shirt collar up to his eyes—or why he sleeps with his head towards
    the fire instead of his feet—why he walks with his toes out instead of
    turning them in—or why it is that hundreds of white folks will flock
    and crowd round a table to see an Indian eat—but he will go home to his
    wigwam fire-side, and “make the welkin ring” with jokes and fun upon
    the ignorance and folly of the knowing world.</p>

  <p>A wild Indian thrown into the civilized atmosphere will see a man
    occasionally moving in society, wearing a cocked hat; and another with
    a laced coat and gold or silver epaulettes upon his shoulders, without
    knowing or enquiring the meaning of them, or the objects for which they
    are worn. Just so a white man travels amongst a wild and untaught tribe
    of Indians, and sees occasionally one of them parading about their
    village, with a head-dress of eagles’ quills and ermine, and elevated
    above it a pair of beautifully polished buffalo horns; and just as
    ignorant is he also, of their meaning or importance; and more so, for
    the first will admit the presumption that epaulettes and cocked hats
    amongst the civilized world, are made for some important purpose,—but
    the latter will presume that horns on an Indian’s head are nothing more
    nor less (nor can they be in their estimation), than Indian nonsense
    and stupidity.</p>

  <p>This brings us to the “corned crest” again, and if the poor Indian
    scans epaulettes and cocked hats, without enquiring their meaning,
    and explaining them to his tribe, it is no reason why I should have
    associated with the noble dignitaries of these western regions, with
    horns and ermine on their heads, and then to have introduced the
    subject without giving some further clue to their importance and
    meaning. For me, this negligence would be doubly unpardonable, as I
    travel, not to <em>trade</em> but to <em>herald</em> the Indian and his
    dying customs to posterity.</p>

  <p>This custom then, which I have before observed belongs to all the
    north-western tribes, is one no doubt of very ancient origin, having
    a purely classic meaning. No one wears the head-dress surmounted with
    horns except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> the dignitaries who are very high in authority, and whose
    exceeding valour, worth, and power is admitted by all the nation.</p>

  <p>He may wear them, however, who is not a <em>chief</em>; but a brave, or
    warrior of such remarkable character, that he is esteemed universally
    in the tribe, as a man whose “voice is as loud in council” as that of a
    chief of the first grade, and consequently his <em>power</em> as great.</p>

  <p>This head-dress with horns is used only on certain occasions, and they
    are very seldom. When foreign chiefs, Indian agents, or other important
    personages visit a tribe; or at war parades, at the celebration of
    a victory, at public festivals, &amp;c. they are worn; but on no other
    occasions—unless, sometimes, when a chief sees fit to lead a war-party
    to battle, he decorates his head with this symbol of power, to
    stimulate his men; and throws himself into the foremost of the battle,
    inviting his enemy to concentrate their shafts upon him.</p>

  <p>The horns on these head-dresses are but loosely attached at the bottom,
    so that they easily fall back or forward, according as the head is
    inclined forward or backward; and by an ingenious motion of the head,
    which is so slight as to be almost imperceptible—they are made to
    balance to and fro, and sometimes, one backward and the other forward
    like a horse’s ears, giving a vast deal of expression and force of
    character, to the appearance of the chief who is wearing them. This,
    reader, is a remarkable instance (like hundreds of others), for its
    striking similarity to <em>Jewish customs</em>, to the kerns (or keren,
    in Hebrew), the horns worn by the Abysinian chiefs and Hebrews, as
    a <em>symbol of power</em> and command; worn at great parades and
    celebrations of victories.</p>

  <p>“The false prophet Zedekiah, made him horns of iron” (1 Kings <abbr title="22">xxii</abbr>.
    11). “Lift not your horns on high; speak not with a stiff neck” (Ps.
    <abbr title="75">lxxv.</abbr> 5).</p>

  <p>This last citation seems so exactly to convey to my mind the mode of
    raising and changing the position of the horns by a motion of the head,
    as I have above described, that I am irresistibly led to believe that
    this custom is now practiced amongst these tribes very nearly as it
    was amongst the Jews; and that it has been, like many other customs of
    which I shall speak more in future epistles, handed down and preserved
    with very little innovation or change from that ancient people.</p>

  <p>The reader will see this custom exemplified in the portrait of
    Mah-to-toh-pa (<a href="#i_064"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 64</a>). This man, although the second chief,
    was the only man in the nation who was allowed to wear the horns; and
    all, I found, looked upon him as the leader, who had the power to
    lead all the warriors in time of war; and that, in consequence of the
    extraordinary battles which he had fought.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MANDAN VILLAGE, UPPER MISSOURI.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">A week</span> or more has elapsed since the date of my last Letter, and
    nothing as yet of the great and curious event—or the <em>Mandan
    religious ceremony</em>. There is evidently much preparation making for
    it, however; and from what I can learn, no one in the nation, save the
    <em>medicine-men</em>, have any knowledge of the exact day on which it is
    to commence. I am informed by the chiefs, that it takes place as soon
    as the willow-tree is in full leaf; for, say they, “the twig which the
    bird brought in was a willow bough, and had full-grown leaves on it.”
    So it seems that this celebration has some relation to the Flood.</p>

  <p>This great occasion is close at hand, and will, undoubtedly, commence
    in a few days; in the meantime I will give a few notes and memorandums,
    which I have made since my last.</p>

  <p>I have been continually at work with my brush, with fine and
    picturesque subjects before me; and from the strange, whimsical,
    and superstitious notions which they have of an art so novel and
    unaccountable to them, I have been initiated into many of their
    mysteries—have witnessed many very curious incidents, and preserved
    several anecdotes, some of which I must relate.</p>

  <p>Perhaps nothing ever more completely astonished these people than
    the operations of my <em>brush</em>. The art of portrait-painting
    was a subject entirely new to them, and of course, unthought of;
    and my appearance here has commenced a new era in the arcana of
    <em>medicine</em> or mystery. Soon after arriving here, I commenced and
    finished the portraits of the two principal chiefs. This was done
    without having awakened the curiosity of the villagers, as they had
    heard nothing of what was going on, and even the chiefs themselves
    seemed to be ignorant of my designs, until the pictures were completed.
    No one else was admitted into my lodge during the operation; and
    when finished, it was exceedingly amusing to see them mutually
    recognizing each other’s likeness, and assuring each other of the
    striking resemblance which they bore to the originals. Both of these
    pressed their hand over their mouths awhile in dead silence (a custom
    amongst most tribes, when anything surprises them very much); looking
    attentively upon the portraits and myself, and upon the palette and
    colours with which these unaccountable effects had been produced.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

  <p>They then walked up to me in the most gentle manner, taking me in
    turn by the hand, with a firm grip; with head and eyes inclined
    downwards, and in a tone a little above a whisper—pronounced the words
    “te-ho-pe-nee Wash-ee!” and walked off.</p>

  <p>Readers, at that moment I was christened with a new and a great
    name—one by which I am now familiarly hailed, and talked of in this
    village; and no doubt will be, as long as traditions last in this
    strange community.</p>

  <p>That moment conferred an honour on me, which you as yet do not
    understand. I took the degree (not of Doctor of Laws, nor Bachelor of
    Arts) of Master of Arts—of mysteries—of magic, and of hocus pocus.
    I was recognized in that short sentence as a “great <em>medicine
    white man</em>;” and since that time, have been regularly installed
    <em>medicine</em> or mystery, which is the most honourable degree that
    could be conferred upon me here; and I now hold a place amongst the
    most eminent and envied personages, the doctors and conjurati of this
    titled community.</p>

  <p>Te-ho-pe-nee Wash-ee (or medicine white man) is the name I now go by,
    and it will prove to me, no doubt, of more value than gold, for I have
    been called upon and feasted by the doctors, who are all mystery-men;
    and it has been an easy and successful passport already to many strange
    and mysterious places; and has put me in possession of a vast deal of
    curious and interesting information, which I am sure I never should
    have otherwise learned. I am daily growing in the estimation of the
    medicine-men and the chiefs; and by assuming all the gravity and
    circumspection due from so high a dignitary (and even considerably
    more); and endeavouring to perform now and then some art or trick that
    is unfathomable, I am in hopes of supporting my standing, until the
    great annual ceremony commences; on which occasion, I may possibly be
    allowed a seat in the <em>medicine-lodge</em> by the doctors, who are the
    sole conductors of this great source and fountain of all priestcraft
    and conjuration in this country.</p>

  <p>After I had finished the portraits of the two chiefs, and they had
    returned to their wigwams, and deliberately seated themselves by their
    respective fire-sides, and silently smoked a pipe or two (according
    to an universal custom), they gradually began to tell what had taken
    place; and at length crowds of gaping listeners, with mouths wide open,
    thronged their lodges; and a throng of women and girls were about my
    house, and through every crack and crevice I could see their glistening
    eyes, which were piercing my hut in a hundred places, from a natural
    and restless propensity, a curiosity to see what was going on within.
    An hour or more passed in this way, and the soft and silken throng
    continually increased, until some hundreds of them were clung, and
    piled about my wigwam like a swarm of bees hanging on the front and
    sides of their hive.</p>

  <p>During this time, not a man made his appearance about the
    premises—after awhile, however, they could be seen, folded in their
    robes, gradually <em>siding</em> up towards the lodge, with a silly look
    upon their faces, which confessed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> once that curiosity was leading
    them reluctantly, where their pride checked and forbade them to go. The
    rush soon after became general, and the chiefs and medicine-men took
    possession of my room, placing <em>soldiers</em> (braves with spears in
    their hands) at the door, admitting no one, but such as were allowed by
    the chiefs, to come in.</p>

  <p>Monsr. Kipp (the agent of the Fur Company, who has lived here eight
    years, and to whom, for his politeness and hospitality, I am much
    indebted), at this time took a seat with the chiefs, and, speaking
    their language fluently, he explained to them my views and the objects
    for which I was painting these portraits; and also expounded to them
    the manner in which they were made,—at which they seemed all to be very
    much pleased. The necessity at this time of exposing the portraits to
    the view of the crowds who were assembled around the house, became
    imperative, and they were held up together over the door, so that
    the whole village had a chance to see and recognize their chiefs.
    The effect upon so mixed a multitude, who as yet had heard no way of
    accounting for them, was novel and really laughable. The likenesses
    were instantly recognized, and many of the gaping multitude commenced
    yelping; some were stamping off in the jarring dance—others were
    singing, and others again were crying—hundreds covered their mouths
    with their hands and were mute; others, indignant, drove their spears
    frightfully into the ground, and some threw a reddened arrow at the
    sun, and went home to their wigwams.</p>

  <p>The pictures seen,—the next curiosity was to see the man who made them,
    and I was called forth. Readers! if you have any imagination, save me
    the trouble of painting this scene. <span class="gesperrtstar">* * * * * * *</span> I stepped forth, and
    was instantly hemmed in in the throng. Women were gaping and gazing—and
    warriors and braves were offering me their hands,—whilst little boys
    and girls, by dozens, were struggling through the crowd to touch me
    with the ends of their fingers; and whilst I was engaged, from the
    waist upwards, in fending off the throng and shaking hands, my legs
    were assailed (not unlike the nibbling of little fish, when I have been
    standing in deep water) by children, who were creeping between the legs
    of the bystanders for the curiosity or honour of touching me with the
    end of their finger. The eager curiosity and expression of astonishment
    with which they gazed upon me, plainly shewed that they looked upon
    me as some strange and unaccountable being. They pronounced me the
    greatest <em>medicine-man</em> in the world; for they said I had made
    <em>living beings</em>,—they said they could see their chiefs alive, in
    two places—those that I had made were a <em>little</em> alive—they could
    see their eyes move—could see them smile and laugh, and that if they
    could laugh they could certainly speak, if they should try, and they
    must therefore have <em>some life</em> in them.</p>

  <p>The squaws generally agreed, that they had discovered life enough in
    them to render my <em>medicine</em> too great for the Mandans; saying
    that such an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span> operation could not be performed without taking away from
    the original something of his existence, which I put in the picture,
    and they could see it move, could see it stir.</p>

  <p>This curtailing of the natural existence, for the purpose of
    instilling life into the secondary one, they decided to be an useless
    and destructive operation, and one which was calculated to do great
    mischief in their happy community; and they commenced a mournful and
    doleful chaunt against me, crying and weeping bitterly through the
    village, proclaiming me a most “dangerous man; one who could make
    living persons by looking at them; and at the same time, could, as
    a matter of course, destroy life in the same way, if I chose. That
    my medicine was dangerous to their lives, and that I must leave the
    village immediately. That bad luck would happen to those whom I
    painted—that I was to take a part of the existence of those whom I
    painted, and carry it home with me amongst the white people, and that
    when they died they would never sleep quiet in their graves.”</p>

  <p>In this way the women and some old quack medicine-men together,
    had succeeded in raising an opposition against me; and the reasons
    they assigned were so plausible and so exactly suited for their
    superstitious feelings, that they completely succeeded in exciting
    fears and a general panic in the minds of a number of chiefs who had
    agreed to sit for their portraits, and my operations were, of course,
    for several days completely at a stand. A grave council was held on
    the subject from day to day, and there seemed great difficulty in
    deciding what was to be done with me and the dangerous art which I was
    practicing; and which had far exceeded their original expectations. I
    finally got admittance to their sacred conclave, and assured them that
    I was but a man like themselves,—that my art had no <em>medicine</em> or
    mystery about it, but could be learned by any of them if they would
    practice it as long as I had—that my intentions towards them were of
    the most friendly kind, and that in the country where I lived, brave
    men never allowed their squaws to frighten them with their foolish
    whims and stories. They all immediately arose, shook me by the hand,
    and dressed themselves for their pictures. After this, there was no
    further difficulty about sitting; all were ready to be painted,—the
    squaws were silent, and my painting-room a continual resort for the
    chiefs, and braves, and medicine-men; where they waited with impatience
    for the completion of each one’s picture,—that they could decide as to
    the likeness as it came from under the brush; that they could laugh,
    and yell, and sing a new song, and smoke a fresh pipe to the health and
    success of him who had just been safely delivered from the hands and
    the mystic operation of the “<em>white medicine</em>.”</p>

  <p>In each of these operations, as they successfully took place, I
    observed that a pipe or two were well filled, and as soon as I
    commenced painting, the chiefs and braves, who sat around the sides
    of the lodge, commenced smoking for the success of the picture (and
    probably as much or more so for the safe deliverance of the sitter from
    harm while under the operation);<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span> and so they continued to pass the
    pipe around until the portrait was completed.</p>

  <p>In this way I progressed with my portraits, stopping occasionally
    very suddenly as if something was wrong, and taking a tremendous puff
    or two at the pipe, and streaming the smoke through my nostrils,
    exhibiting in my looks and actions an evident relief; enabling me to
    proceed with more facility and success,—by flattering and complimenting
    each one on his good looks after I had got it done, and taking them
    according to rank, or standing, making it a matter of honour with them,
    which pleased them exceedingly, and gave me and my art the stamp of
    respectability at once.</p>

  <p>I was then taken by the arm by the chiefs, and led to their lodges,
    where feasts were prepared for me in elegant style, <i>i. e.</i> in
    the best manner which this country affords; and being led by the arm,
    and welcomed to them by <em>gentlemen</em> of high and exalted feelings,
    rendered them in my estimation truly elegant.</p>

  <p>I was waited upon in due form and ceremony by the <em>medicine-men</em>,
    who received me upon the old adage, “Similis simili gaudet.” I was
    invited to a feast, and they presented me a <i lang="mhq">she-shee-quoi</i>,
    or a doctor’s rattle, and also a magical wand, or a doctor’s staff,
    strung with claws of the grizzly bear, with hoofs of the antelope—with
    ermine—with wild sage and bat’s wings—and perfumed withal with the
    <em>choice</em> and <em>savoury</em> odour of the pole-cat—a dog was
    sacrificed and hung by the legs over my wigwam, and I was therefore and
    thereby initiated into (and countenanced in the practice of) the arcana
    of medicine or mystery, and considered a Fellow of the Extraordinary
    Society of <em>Conjurati</em>.</p>

  <p>Since this signal success and good fortune in my operations, things
    have gone on very pleasantly, and I have had a great deal of amusement.
    Some altercation has taken place, however, amongst the chiefs and
    braves, with regard to standing or rank, of which they are exceedingly
    jealous; and they must sit (if at all) in regular order, according to
    that rank; the trouble is all settled at last, however, and I have had
    no want of subjects, though a great many have become again alarmed,
    and are unwilling to sit, for fear, as some say, that they will die
    prematurely if painted; and as others say, that if they are painted,
    the picture will live after they are dead, and they cannot sleep quiet
    in their graves.</p>

  <p>I have had several most remarkable occurrences in my painting-room, of
    this kind, which have made me some everlasting enemies here; though
    the minds and feelings of the chiefs and medicine-men have not been
    affected by them. There has been three or four instances where proud
    and aspiring young men have been in my lodge, and after gazing at the
    portraits of the head chief across the room (which sits looking them
    in the eyes), have raised their hands before their faces and walked
    around to the side of the lodge, on the right or left, from whence to
    take a long and fair side-look at the chief, instead of staring him
    full in the face (which is a most unpardonable offence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span> in all Indian
    tribes); and after having got in that position, and cast their eyes
    again upon the portrait which was yet looking them full in the face,
    have thrown their robes over their heads and bolted out of the wigwam,
    filled equally with astonishment and indignation; averring, as they
    always will in a sullen mood, that they “saw the eyes move,”—that as
    they walked around the room “the eyes of the portrait followed them.”
    With these unfortunate gentlemen, repeated efforts have been made by
    the Traders, and also by the chiefs and doctors, who understand the
    illusion, to convince them of their error, by explaining the mystery;
    but they will not hear to any explanation whatever; saying, that “what
    they see with their eyes is always evidence enough for them;” that they
    always “believe their own eyes sooner than a hundred tongues,” and all
    efforts to get them a second time to my room, or into my company in any
    place, have proved entirely unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>I had trouble brewing also the other day from another source; one of
    the “<em>medicines</em>” commenced howling and haranguing around my
    domicil, amongst the throng that was outside, proclaiming that all who
    were inside and being painted were fools and would soon die; and very
    materially affecting thereby my popularity. I however sent for him
    and called him in the next morning, when I was alone, having only the
    interpreter with me; telling him that I had had my eye upon him for
    several days, and had been so well pleased with his looks, that I had
    taken great pains to find out his history, which had been explained by
    all as one of a most extraordinary kind, and his character and standing
    in his tribe as worthy of my particular notice; and that I had several
    days since resolved that as soon as I had practiced my hand long enough
    upon the others, to get the stiffness out of it (after paddling my
    canoe so far as I had) and make it to work easily and successfully,
    I would begin on his portrait, which I was then prepared to commence
    on that day, and that I felt as if I could do him justice. He shook
    me by the hand, giving me the “Doctor’s grip,” and beckoned me to sit
    down, which I did, and we smoked a pipe together. After this was over,
    he told me, that “he had no inimical feelings towards me, although he
    had been telling the chiefs that they were all fools, and all would
    die who had their portraits painted—that although he had set the old
    women and children all crying, and even made some of the young warriors
    tremble, yet he had no unfriendly feelings towards me, nor any fear
    or dread of my art.” “I know you are a good man (said he), I know you
    will do no harm to any one, your medicine is great and you are a great
    ‘medicine-man.’ I would like to see myself very well—and so would all
    of the chiefs; but they have all been many days in this medicine-house,
    and they all know me well, and they have not asked me to come in and be
    <em>made alive</em> with paints—my friend, I am glad that my people have
    told you who I am—my heart is glad—I will go to my wigwam and eat, and
    in a little while I will come, and you may go to work;”—another pipe
    was lit and smoked, and he got up and went off. I prepared my canvass
    and palette,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> and whistled away the time until twelve o’clock, before
    he made his appearance; having used the whole of the fore-part of the
    day at his toilette, arranging his dress and ornamenting his body for
    his picture.</p>

  <figure class="mt2 illowp75" id="i_055">
  <div class="plate"><i>30</i></div>
    <img src="images/i_055.jpg" alt="" />
     <figcaption>55</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>At that hour then, bedaubed and streaked with paints of various
    colours, with bear’s grease and charcoal, with medicine-pipes in his
    hands and foxes tails attached to his heels, entered Mah-to-he-ha (the
    old bear, <a href="#i_055"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 55</a>), with a train of his own profession, who
    seated themselves around him; and also a number of boys, whom it was
    requested should remain with him, and whom I supposed it possible
    might have been pupils, whom he was instructing in the mysteries of
    <i>materia medica</i> and <i>hoca poca</i>. He took his position in
    the middle of the room, waving his eagle calumets in each hand, and
    singing his medicine-song which he sings over his dying patient,
    looking me full in the face until I completed his picture, which I
    painted at full length. His vanity has been completely gratified in
    the operation; he lies for hours together, day after day, in my room,
    in front of his picture, gazing intensely upon it; lights my pipe for
    me while I am painting—shakes hands with me a dozen times on each day,
    and talks of me, and enlarges upon my <em>medicine</em> virtues and my
    talents, wherever he goes; so that this new difficulty is now removed,
    and instead of preaching against me, he is one of my strongest and most
    enthusiastic friends and aids in the country.</p>

  <p>There is yet to be described another sort of personage, that is often
    seen stalking about in all Indian communities, a kind of nondescript,
    with whom I have been somewhat annoyed, and still more amused, since I
    came to this village, of whom (or of <em>which</em>) I shall give some
    account in my next epistle.</p>

  <hr class="chap" />
  <div class="chapter">
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>

  </div>
  <div class="subheadc">MANDAN VILLAGE, UPPER MISSOURI.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Besides</span> chiefs, and braves and doctors, of whom I have heretofore
    spoken, there is yet another character of whom I must say a few words
    before I proceed to other topics. The person I allude to, is the one
    mentioned at the close of my last Letter, and familiarly known and
    countenanced in every tribe as an Indian <i lang="fr">beau</i> or <em>dandy</em>.
    Such personages may be seen on every pleasant day, strutting and
    parading around the village in the most beautiful and unsoiled dresses,
    without the honourable trophies however of scalp locks and claws of
    the grizzly bear, attached to their costume, for with such things they
    deal not. They are not peculiarly anxious to hazard their lives in
    equal and honourable combat with the one, or disposed to cross the path
    of the other; but generally remain about the village, to take care of
    the women, and attire themselves in the skins of such animals as they
    can easily kill, without seeking the rugged cliffs for the war-eagle,
    or visiting the haunts of the grizzly bear. They plume themselves
    with swan’s-down and quills of ducks, with braids and plaits of
    sweet-scented grass and other harmless and unmeaning ornaments, which
    have no other merit than they themselves have, that of looking pretty
    and ornamental.</p>

  <p>These clean and elegant gentlemen, who are very few in each tribe, are
    held in very little estimation by the chiefs and braves; inasmuch as it
    is known by all, that they have a most horrible aversion to arms, and
    are denominated “faint hearts” or “old women” by the whole tribe, and
    are therefore but little respected. They seem, however, to be tolerably
    well contented with the appellation, together with the celebrity
    they have acquired amongst the women and children for the beauty and
    elegance of their personal appearance; and most of them seem to take
    and enjoy their share of the world’s pleasures, although they are
    looked upon as drones in society.</p>

  <p>These gay and tinselled bucks may be seen in a pleasant day in all
    their plumes, astride of their pied or dappled ponies, with a fan in
    the right hand, made of a turkey’s tail—with whip and a fly-brush
    attached to the wrist of the same hand, and underneath them a white and
    beautiful and soft pleasure-saddle, ornamented with porcupine quills
    and ermine, parading through and lounging about the village for an hour
    or so, when they will cautiously bend their course to the suburbs of
    the town, where they will sit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span> or recline upon their horses for an hour
    or two, overlooking the beautiful games where the braves and the young
    aspirants are contending in manly and athletic amusements;—when they
    are fatigued with this severe effort, they wend their way back again,
    lift off their fine white saddle of doe’s-skin, which is wadded with
    buffalo’s hair, turn out their pony—take a little refreshment, smoke a
    pipe, fan themselves to sleep, and doze away the rest of the day.</p>

  <p>Whilst I have been painting, from day to day, there have been two or
    three of these fops continually strutting and taking their attitudes
    in front of my door; decked out in all their finery, without receiving
    other benefit or other information, than such as they could discover
    through the cracks and seams of my cabin. The chiefs, I observed,
    passed them by without notice, and of course, without inviting them
    in; and they seemed to figure about my door from day to day in their
    best dresses and best attitudes, as if in hopes that I would select
    them as models, for my canvass. It was natural that I should do so,
    for their costume and personal appearance was entirely more beautiful
    than anything else to be seen in the village. My plans were laid,
    and one day when I had got through with all of the head men, who
    were willing to sit to be painted, and there were two or three of
    the chiefs lounging in my room, I stepped to the door and tapped one
    of these fellows on the shoulder, who took the hint, and stepped in,
    well-pleased and delighted with the signal and honourable notice I had
    at length taken of him and his beautiful dress. Readers, you cannot
    imagine what was the expression of gratitude which beamed forth in
    this poor fellow’s face, and how high his heart beat with joy and
    pride at the idea of my selecting him to be immortal, alongside of the
    chiefs and worthies whose portraits he saw arranged around the room;
    and by which honour he, undoubtedly, considered himself well paid for
    two or three weeks of regular painting, and greasing, and dressing,
    and standing alternately on one leg and the other at the door of my
    premises.</p>

  <p>Well, I placed him before me, and a canvass on my easel, and “chalked
    him out” at full length. He was truly a beautiful subject for the
    brush, and I was filled with enthusiasm—his dress from head to foot was
    of the skins of the mountain-goat, and dressed so neatly, that they
    were almost as soft and as white as Canton crape—around the bottom and
    the sides it was trimmed with ermine, and porcupine quills of beautiful
    dyes garnished it in a hundred parts;—his hair which was long, and
    spread over his back and shoulders, extending nearly to the ground, was
    all combed back and parted on his forehead like that of a woman. He
    was a tall and fine figure, with ease and grace in his movements, that
    were well worthy of a man of better caste. In his left hand he held a
    beautiful pipe—and in his right hand he plied his fan, and on his wrist
    was still attached his whip of elk’s horn, and his fly-brush, made of
    the buffalo’s tail. There was nought about him of the terrible, and
    nought to shock the finest, chastest intellect.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

  <p>I had thus far progressed, with high-wrought feelings of pleasure,
    when the two or three chiefs, who had been seated around the lodge,
    and whose portraits I had before painted, arose suddenly, and wrapping
    themselves tightly in their robes, crossed my room with a quick and
    heavy step, and took an informal leave of my cabin. I was apprehensive
    of their displeasure, though I continued my work; and in a few moments
    the interpreter came furiously into my room, addressing me thus:—“My
    God, Sir! this never will do; you have given great offence to the
    chiefs—they have made complaint of your conduct to me—they tell me
    this is a worthless fellow—a man of no account in the nation, and if
    you paint his picture, you must instantly destroy theirs; you have no
    alternative, my dear Sir—and the quicker this chap is out of your lodge
    the better.”</p>

  <p>The same matter was explained to my sitter by the interpreter, when
    he picked up his robe, wrapped himself in it, plied his fan nimbly
    about his face, and walked out of the lodge in silence, but with quite
    a consequential smile, taking his old position in front of the door
    for awhile, after which he drew himself quietly off without further
    exhibition. So highly do Mandan braves and worthies value the honour
    of being painted; and so little do they value a man, however lavishly
    Nature may have bestowed her master touches upon him, who has not the
    pride and noble bearing of a warrior.</p>

  <p>I spoke in a former Letter of Mah-to-toh-pa (the four bears), the
    second chief of the nation, and the most popular man of the Mandans—a
    high-minded and gallant warrior, as well as a polite and polished
    gentleman. Since I painted his portrait, as I before described, I
    have received at his hands many marked and signal attentions; some
    of which I must name to you, as the very relation of them will put
    you in possession of many little forms and modes of Indian life, that
    otherwise might not have been noted.</p>

  <p>About a week since, this noble fellow stepped into my painting-room
    about twelve o’clock in the day, in full and splendid dress, and
    passing his arm through mine, pointed the way, and led me in the most
    gentlemanly manner, through the village and into his own lodge, where
    a feast was prepared in a careful manner and waiting our arrival. The
    lodge in which he dwelt was a room of immense size, some forty or fifty
    feet in diameter, in a circular form, and about twenty feet high—with a
    sunken curb of stone in the centre, of five or six feet in diameter and
    one foot deep, which contained the fire over which the pot was boiling.
    I was led near the edge of this curb, and seated on a very handsome
    robe, most ingeniously garnished and painted with hieroglyphics; and he
    seated himself gracefully on another one at a little distance from me;
    with the feast prepared in several dishes, resting on a beautiful rush
    mat, which was placed between us (<a href="#i_062"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 62</a>).</p>

  <p>The simple feast which was spread before us consisted of three dishes
    only, two of which were served in wooden bowls, and the third in
    an earthen vessel of their own manufacture, somewhat in shape of a
    bread-tray in our own country. This last contained a quantity of
    <em>pem-i-can</em> and <em>marrow-fat</em>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span> and one of the former held
    a fine brace of buffalo ribs, delightfully roasted; and the other
    was filled with a kind of paste or pudding, made of the flour of the
    “<i lang="fr">pomme blanche</i>,” as the French call it, a delicious turnip of
    the prairie, finely flavoured with the buffalo berries, which are
    collected in great quantities in this country, and used with divers
    dishes in cooking, as we in civilized countries use dried currants,
    which they very much resemble.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>31</i></div>
  <figure id="i_062">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_062.jpg" alt="" />
     <figcaption>62</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>A handsome pipe and a tobacco-pouch made of the otter skin, filled with
    k’nick-k’neck (Indian tobacco), laid by the side of the feast; and when
    we were seated, mine host took up his pipe, and deliberately filled
    it; and instead of lighting it by the fire, which he could easily have
    done, he drew from his pouch his flint and steel, and raised a spark
    with which he kindled it. He drew a few strong whiffs through it, and
    presented the stem of it to my mouth, through which I drew a whiff or
    two while he held the stem in his hands. This done, he laid down the
    pipe, and drawing his knife from his belt, cut off a very small piece
    of the meat from the ribs, and pronouncing the words “Ho-pe-ne-chee
    wa-pa-shee” (meaning a <em>medicine</em> sacrifice), threw it into the
    fire.</p>

  <p>He then (by signals) requested me to eat, and I commenced, after
    drawing out from my belt my knife (which it is supposed that every man
    in this country carries about him, for at an Indian feast a knife is
    never offered to a guest). Reader, be not astonished that I sat and
    ate my dinner <em>alone</em>, for such is the custom of this strange
    land. In all tribes in these western regions it is an invariable rule
    that a chief never eats with his guests invited to a feast; but while
    they eat, he sits by, at their service, and ready to wait upon them;
    deliberately charging and lighting the pipe which is to be passed
    around after the feast is over. Such was the case in the present
    instance, and while I was eating, Mah-to-toh-pa sat cross-legged before
    me, cleaning his pipe and preparing it for a cheerful smoke when I had
    finished my meal. For this ceremony I observed he was making unusual
    preparation, and I observed as I ate, that after he had taken enough
    of the k’nick-k’neck or bark of the red willow, from his pouch, he
    rolled out of it also a piece of the “<em>castor</em>,” which it is
    customary amongst these folks to carry in their tobacco-sack to give it
    a flavour; and, shaving off a small quantity of it, mixed it with the
    bark, with which he charged his pipe. This done, he drew also from his
    sack a small parcel containing a fine powder, which was made of dried
    buffalo dung, a little of which he spread over the top, (according also
    to custom,) which was like tinder, having no other effect than that of
    lighting the pipe with ease and satisfaction. My appetite satiated,
    I straightened up, and with a whiff the pipe was lit, and we enjoyed
    together for a quarter of an hour the most delightful exchange of good
    feelings, amid clouds of smoke and pantomimic signs and gesticulations.</p>

  <p>The dish of “pemican and marrow-fat,” of which I spoke, was thus:—The
    first, an article of food used throughout this country, as familiarly
    as we use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span> bread in the civilized world. It is made of buffalo meat
    dried very hard, and afterwards pounded in a large wooden mortar until
    it is made nearly as fine as sawdust, then packed in this dry state in
    bladders or sacks of skin, and is easily carried to any part of the
    world in good order. “Marrow-fat” is collected by the Indians from
    the buffalo bones which they break to pieces, yielding a prodigious
    quantity of marrow, which is boiled out and put into buffalo bladders
    which have been distended; and after it cools, becomes quite hard like
    tallow, and has the appearance, and very nearly the flavour, of the
    richest yellow butter. At a feast, chunks of this marrow-fat are cut
    off and placed in a tray or bowl, with the pemican, and eaten together;
    which we civilized folks in these regions consider a very good
    substitute for (and indeed we generally so denominate it) “bread and
    butter.” In this dish laid a spoon made of the buffalo’s horn, which
    was black as jet, and beautifully polished; in one of the others there
    was another of still more ingenious and beautiful workmanship, made of
    the horn of the mountain-sheep, or “Gros corn,” as the French trappers
    call them; it was large enough to hold of itself two or three pints,
    and was almost entirely transparent.</p>

  <p>I spoke also of the earthen dishes or bowls in which these viands were
    served out; they are a familiar part of the culinary furniture of
    every Mandan lodge, and are manufactured by the women of this tribe
    in great quantities, and modelled into a thousand forms and tastes.
    They are made by the hands of the women, from a tough black clay, and
    baked in kilns which are made for the purpose, and are nearly equal in
    hardness to our own manufacture of pottery; though they have not yet
    got the art of glazing, which would be to them a most valuable secret.
    They make them so strong and serviceable, however, that they hang them
    over the fire as we do our iron pots, and boil their meat in them with
    perfect success. I have seen some few specimens of such manufacture,
    which have been dug up in Indian mounds and tombs in the southern and
    middle states, placed in our Eastern Museums and looked upon as a great
    wonder, when here this novelty is at once done away with, and the whole
    mystery; where women can be seen handling and using them by hundreds,
    and they can be seen every day in the summer also, moulding them into
    many fanciful forms, and passing them through the kiln where they are
    hardened.</p>

  <p>Whilst sitting at this feast the wigwam was as silent as death,
    although we were not alone in it. This chief, like most others, had a
    plurality of wives, and all of them (some six or seven) were seated
    around the sides of the lodge, upon robes or mats placed upon the
    ground, and not allowed to speak, though they were in readiness to obey
    his orders or commands, which were uniformly given by signs manual, and
    executed in the neatest and most silent manner.</p>

  <p>When I arose to return, the pipe through which we had smoked was
    presented to me; and the robe on which I had sat, he gracefully raised
    by the corners and tendered it to me, explaining by signs that the
    paintings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span> which were on it were the representations of the battles of
    his life, where he had fought and killed with his own hand fourteen
    of his enemies; that he had been two weeks engaged in painting it for
    me, and that he had invited me here on this occasion to present it to
    me. The robe, readers, which I shall describe in a future epistle, I
    took upon my shoulder, and he took me by the arm and led me back to my
    painting-room.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MANDAN VILLAGE, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">I mentioned</span> in the foregoing epistle, that the chiefs of the Mandans
    frequently have a plurality of wives. Such is the custom amongst all of
    these North Western tribes, and a few general remarks on this subject
    will apply to them all, and save the trouble of repeating them.</p>

  <p>Polygamy is countenanced amongst all of the North American Indians, so
    far as I have visited them; and it is no uncommon thing to find a chief
    with six, eight, or ten, and some with twelve or fourteen wives in his
    lodge. Such is an ancient custom, and in their estimation is right as
    well as necessary. Women in a savage state, I believe, are always held
    in a rank inferior to that of the men, in relation to whom in many
    respects they stand rather in the light of menials and slaves than
    otherwise; and as they are the “hewers of wood and drawers of water,”
    it becomes a matter of necessity for a chief (who must be liberal,
    keep open doors, and entertain, for the support of his popularity) to
    have in his wigwam a sufficient number of such handmaids or menials to
    perform the numerous duties and drudgeries of so large and expensive an
    establishment.</p>

  <p>There are two other reasons for this custom which operate with
    equal, if not with greater force than the one above assigned. In the
    first place, these people, though far behind the civilized world in
    acquisitiveness, have still more or less passion for the accumulation
    of wealth, or, in other words, for the luxuries of life; and a
    chief, excited by a desire of this kind, together with a wish to be
    able to furnish his lodge with something more than ordinary for the
    entertainment of his own people, as well as strangers who fall upon his
    hospitality, sees fit to marry a number of wives, who are kept at hard
    labour during most of the year; and the avails of that labour enable
    him to procure those luxuries, and give to his lodge the appearance
    of respectability which is not ordinarily seen. Amongst those tribes
    who trade with the Fur Companies, this system is carried out to a
    great extent, and the women are kept for the greater part of the
    year, dressing buffalo robes and other skins for the market; and the
    brave or chief, who has the greatest number of wives, is considered
    the most affluent and envied man in the tribe; for his table is most
    bountifully supplied, and his lodge the most abundantly furnished with
    the luxuries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span> of civilized manufacture, who has at the year’s end the
    greatest number of robes to vend to the Fur Company.</p>

  <p>The manual labour amongst savages is all done by the women; and as
    there are no daily labourers or persons who will “<em>hire out</em>” to
    labour for another, it becomes necessary for him who requires more than
    the labour or services of one, to add to the number by legalizing and
    compromising by the ceremony of marriage, his stock of labourers; who
    can thus, and thus alone, be easily enslaved, and the results of their
    labour turned to good account.</p>

  <p>There is yet the other inducement, which probably is more effective
    than either; the natural inclination which belongs to man, who
    stands high in the estimation of his people and wields the sceptre
    of power—surrounded by temptations which he considers it would be
    unnatural to resist, where no law or regulation of society stands
    in the way of his enjoyment. Such a custom amongst savage nations
    can easily be excused too, and we are bound to excuse it, when
    we behold man in a state of nature, as he was made, following a
    natural inclination, which is sanctioned by ancient custom and by
    their religion, without a law or regulation of their society to
    discountenance it; and when, at the same time, such an accumulation of
    a man’s household, instead of quadrupling his expenses (as would be
    the case in the civilized world), actually becomes his wealth, as the
    results of their labour abundantly secure to him all the necessaries
    and luxuries of life.</p>

  <p>There are other and very rational grounds on which the propriety
    of such a custom may be urged, one of which is as follows:—as all
    nations of Indians in their natural condition are unceasingly at war
    with the tribes that are about them, for the adjustment of ancient
    and never-ending feuds, as well as from a love of glory, to which in
    Indian life the battle-field is almost the only road, their warriors
    are killed off to that extent, that in many instances two and sometimes
    three women to a man are found in a tribe. In such instances I have
    found that the custom of polygamy has kindly helped the community to an
    evident relief from a cruel and prodigious calamity.</p>

  <p>The instances of which I have above spoken, are generally confined to
    the chiefs and medicine-men; though there is no regulation prohibiting
    a poor or obscure individual from marrying several wives, other than
    the personal difficulties which lie between him and the hand which he
    wishes in vain to get, for want of sufficient celebrity in society, or
    from a still more frequent objection, that of his inability (from want
    of worldly goods) to deal in the customary way with the fathers of the
    girls whom he would appropriate to his own household.</p>

  <p>There are very few instances indeed, to be seen in these regions, where
    a poor or ordinary citizen has more than one wife; but amongst chiefs
    and braves of great reputation, and doctors, it is common to see some
    six or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span> eight living under one roof, and all apparently quiet and
    contented; seemingly harmonizing, and enjoying the modes of life and
    treatment that falls to their lot.</p>

  <p>Wives in this country are mostly treated for with the father, as in all
    instances they are regularly bought and sold. In many cases the bargain
    is made with the father alone, without ever consulting the inclinations
    of the girl, and seems to be conducted on his part as a mercenary
    contract entirely, where he stands out for the highest price he can
    possibly command for her. There are other instances to be sure, where
    the parties approach each other, and from the expression of a mutual
    fondness, make their own arrangements, and pass their own mutual vows,
    which are quite as sacred and inviolable as similar assurances when
    made in the civilized world. Yet even in such cases, the marriage is
    never consummated without the necessary form of making presents to the
    father of the girl.</p>

  <p>It becomes a matter of policy and almost of absolute necessity, for the
    white men who are Traders in these regions to connect themselves in
    this way, to one or more of the most influential families in the tribe,
    which in a measure identifies their interest with that of the nation,
    and enables them, with the influence of their new family connexions,
    to carry on successfully their business transactions with them. The
    young women of the best families only can aspire to such an elevation;
    and the most of them are exceedingly ambitious for such a connexion,
    inasmuch as they are certain of a delightful exemption from the slavish
    duties that devolve upon them when married under other circumstances;
    and expect to be, as they generally are, allowed to lead a life of ease
    and idleness, covered with mantles of blue and scarlet cloth—with beads
    and trinkets, and ribbons, in which they flounce and flirt about, the
    envied and tinselled belles of every tribe.</p>

  <p>These connexions, however, can scarcely be called marriages, for I
    believe they are generally entered into without the form or solemnizing
    ceremony of a marriage, and on the part of the father of the girls,
    conducted purely as a mercenary or business transaction; in which
    they are very expert, and practice a deal of shrewdness in exacting
    an adequate price from a purchaser whom they consider possessed of
    so large and so rich a stock of the world’s goods; and who they deem
    abundantly able to pay liberally for so delightful a commodity.</p>

  <p>Almost every Trader and every clerk who commences in the business of
    this country, speedily enters into such an arrangement, which is done
    with as little ceremony as he would bargain for a horse, and just as
    unceremoniously do they annul and abolish this connexion when they
    wish to leave the country, or change their positions from one tribe to
    another; at which time the woman is left, a fair and proper candidate
    for matrimony or speculation, when another applicant comes along, and
    her father equally desirous for another horse or gun, &amp;c. which he can
    easily command at her second espousal.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

  <p>From the enslaved and degraded condition in which the women are held in
    the Indian country, the world would naturally think that theirs must
    be a community formed of incongruous and unharmonizing materials; and
    consequently destitute of the fine, reciprocal feelings and attachments
    which flow from the domestic relations in the civilized world; yet it
    would be untrue, and doing injustice to the Indians, to say that they
    were in the least behind us in conjugal, in filial, and in paternal
    affection. There is no trait in the human character which is more
    universal than the attachments which flow from these relations, and
    there is no part of the human species who have a stronger affection and
    a higher regard for them than the North American Indians.</p>

  <p>There is no subject in the Indian character of more importance to be
    rightly understood than this, and none either that has furnished me
    more numerous instances and more striking proofs, of which I shall
    make use on a future occasion, when I shall say a vast deal more of
    marriage—of divorce—of polygamy—and of Indian domestic relations. For
    the present I am scribbling about the looks and usages of the Indians
    who are about me and under my eye; and I must not digress too much into
    general remarks, lest I lose sight of those who are near me, and the
    first to be heralded.</p>

  <p>Such, then, are the Mandans—their women are beautiful and modest,—and
    amongst the respectable families, virtue is as highly cherished and
    as inapproachable, as in any society whatever; yet at the same time a
    chief may marry a dozen wives if he pleases, and so may a white man;
    and if either wishes to marry the most beautiful and modest girl in the
    tribe, she is valued only equal, perhaps, to two horses, a gun with
    powder and ball for a year, five or six pounds of beads, a couple of
    gallons of whiskey, and a handful of awls.</p>

  <p>The girls of this tribe, like those of most of these north-western
    tribes, marry at the age of twelve or fourteen, and some at the age of
    eleven years; and their beauty, from this fact, as well as from the
    slavish life they lead, soon after marriage vanishes. Their occupations
    are almost continual, and they seem to go industriously at them, as if
    from choice or inclination, without a murmur.</p>

  <p>The principal occupations of the women in this village, consist in
    procuring wood and water, in cooking, dressing robes and other skins,
    in drying meat and wild fruit, and raising corn (maize). The Mandans
    are somewhat of agriculturists, as they raise a great deal of corn and
    some pumpkins and squashes. This is all done by the women, who make
    their hoes of the shoulder-blade of the buffalo or the elk, and dig the
    ground over instead of ploughing it, which is consequently done with a
    vast deal of labour. They raise a very small sort of corn, the ears of
    which are not longer than a man’s thumb. This variety is well adapted
    to their climate, as it ripens sooner than other varieties, which
    would not mature in so cold a latitude. The green corn season is one
    of great festivity with them, and one of much importance. The greater
    part of their crop is eaten during these festivals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span> and the remainder
    is gathered and dried on the cob, before it has ripened, and packed
    away in “<i lang="fr">caches</i>” (as the French call them), holes dug in the
    ground, some six or seven feet deep, the insides of which are somewhat
    in the form of a jug, and tightly closed at the top. The corn, and even
    dried meat and pemican, are placed in these <i lang="fr">caches</i>, being packed
    tight around the sides., with prairie grass, and effectually preserved
    through the severest winters.</p>

  <p>Corn and dried meat are generally laid in in the fall, in sufficient
    quantities to support them through the winter. These are the principal
    articles of food during that long and inclement season; and in addition
    to them, they oftentimes have in store great quantities of dried
    squashes and dried “<i lang="fr">pommes blanches</i>,” a kind of turnip which
    grows in great abundance in these regions, and of which I have before
    spoken. These are dried in great quantities, and pounded into a sort of
    meal, and cooked with the dried meat and corn. Great quantities also of
    wild fruit of different kinds are dried and laid away in store for the
    winter season, such as buffalo berries, service berries, strawberries,
    and wild plums.</p>

  <p>The buffalo meat, however, is the great staple and “staff of life” in
    this country, and seldom (if ever) fails to afford them an abundant and
    wholesome means of subsistence. There are, from a fair computation,
    something like 250,000 Indians in these western regions, who live
    almost exclusively on the flesh of these animals, through every part of
    the year. During the summer and fall months they use the meat fresh,
    and cook it in a great variety of ways, by roasting, broiling, boiling,
    stewing, smoking, &amp;c.; and by boiling the ribs and joints with the
    marrow in them, make a delicious soup, which is universally used, and
    in vast quantities. The Mandans, I find, have no regular or stated
    times for their meals, but generally eat about twice in the twenty-four
    hours. The pot is always boiling over the fire, and any one who is
    hungry (either of the household or from any other part of the village)
    has a right to order it taken off, and to fall to eating as he pleases.
    Such is an unvarying custom amongst the North American Indians, and I
    very much doubt, whether the civilized world have in their institutions
    any system which can properly be called more humane and charitable.
    Every man, woman, or child in Indian communities is allowed to enter
    any one’s lodge, and even that of the chief of the nation, and eat when
    they are hungry, provided misfortune or necessity has driven them to
    it. Even so can the poorest and most worthless drone of the nation; if
    he is too lazy to hunt or to supply himself, he can walk into any lodge
    and everyone will share with him as long as there is anything to eat.
    He, however, who thus begs when he is able to hunt, pays dear for his
    meat, for he is stigmatized with the disgraceful epithet of a poltroon
    and a beggar.</p>

  <p>The Mandans, like all other tribes, sit at their meals cross-legged,
    or rather with their ancles crossed in front of them, and both feet
    drawn close under their bodies; or, which is very often the case also,
    take their meals in a reclining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span> posture, with the legs thrown out, and
    the body resting on one elbow and fore-arm, which are under them. The
    dishes from which they eat are invariably on the ground or floor of
    the lodge, and the group resting on buffalo robes or mats of various
    structure and manufacture.</p>

  <p>The position in which the women sit at their meals and on other
    occasions is different from that of the men, and one which they
    take and rise from again, with great ease and much grace, by merely
    bending the knees both together, inclining the body back and the head
    and shoulders quite forward, they squat entirely down to the ground,
    inclining both feet either to the right or the left. In this position
    they always rest while eating, and it is both modest and graceful, for
    they seem, with apparent ease, to assume the position and rise out of
    it, without using their hands in any way to assist them.</p>

  <p>These women, however, although graceful and civil, and ever so
    beautiful or ever so hungry, are not allowed to sit in the same group
    with the men while at their meals. So far as I have yet travelled in
    the Indian country, I never have seen an Indian woman eating with
    her husband. Men form the first group at the banquet, and women, and
    children and dogs all come together at the next, and these gormandize
    and glut themselves to an enormous extent, though the men very seldom
    do.</p>

  <p>It is time that an error on this subject, which has gone generally
    abroad in the world, was corrected. It is everywhere asserted, and
    almost universally believed, that the Indians are “enormous eaters;”
    but comparatively speaking, I assure my readers that this is an error.
    I venture to say that there are no persons on earth who practice
    greater prudence and self-denial, than the men do (amongst the wild
    Indians), who are constantly in war and in the chase, or in their
    athletic sports and exercises; for all of which they are excited by
    the highest ideas of pride and honour, and every kind of excess is
    studiously avoided; and for a very great part of their lives, the most
    painful abstinence is enforced upon themselves, for the purpose of
    preparing their bodies and their limbs for these extravagant exertions.
    Many a man who has been a few weeks along the frontier, amongst the
    drunken, naked and beggared part of the Indian race, and run home
    and written a book on Indians, has, no doubt, often seen them eat to
    beastly excess; and he has seen them also guzzle whiskey (and perhaps
    <em>sold</em> it to them) till he has seen them glutted and besotted,
    without will or energy to move; and many and thousands of such things
    can always be seen, where white people have made beggars of them, and
    they have nothing to do but lie under a fence and beg a whole week to
    get meat and whiskey enough for one feast and one carouse; but amongst
    the wild Indians in this country there are no beggars—no drunkards—and
    every man, from a beautiful natural precept, studies to keep his body
    and mind in such a healthy shape and condition as will at all times
    enable him to use his weapons in self-defence, or struggle for the
    prize in their manly games.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

  <p>As I before observed, these men generally eat but twice a day, and many
    times not more than once, and those meals are light and simple compared
    with the meals that are swallowed in the civilized world; and by the
    very people also, who sit at the festive board three times a day,
    making a jest of the Indian for his eating, when they actually guzzle
    more liquids, besides their eating, than would fill the stomach of an
    Indian.</p>

  <p>There are, however, many seasons and occasions in the year with all
    Indians, when they fast for several days in succession; and others
    where they can <em>get</em> nothing to eat; and at such times (their
    habits are such) they may be seen to commence with an enormous meal,
    and because they do so, it is an insufficient reason why we should for
    ever remain under so egregious an error with regard to a single custom
    of these people.</p>

  <p>I have seen so many of these, and lived with them, and travelled with
    them, and oftentimes felt as if I should starve to death on an equal
    allowance, that I am fully convinced I am correct in saying that the
    North American Indians, taking them in the aggregate, even where they
    have an abundance to subsist on, eat less than any civilized population
    of equal numbers, that I have ever travelled amongst.</p>

  <p>Their mode of curing and preserving the buffalo meat is somewhat
    curious, and in fact it is almost incredible also; for it is all cured
    or dried in the sun, without the aid of salt or smoke! The method
    of doing this is the same amongst all the tribes, from this to the
    Mexican Provinces, and is as follows:—The choicest parts of the flesh
    from the buffalo are cut out by the squaws, and carried home on their
    backs or on horses, and there cut “<em>across the grain</em>,” in such a
    manner as will take alternately the layers of lean and fat; and having
    prepared it all in this way, in strips about half an inch in thickness,
    it is hung up by hundreds and thousands of pounds on poles resting on
    crotches, out of the reach of dogs or wolves, and exposed to the rays
    of the sun for several days, when it becomes so effectually dried, that
    it can be carried to any part of the world without damage. This seems
    almost an unaccountable thing, and the more so, as it is done in the
    hottest months of the year, and also in all the different latitudes of
    an Indian country.</p>

  <p>So singular a fact as this can only be accounted for, I consider, on
    the ground of the extraordinary rarity and purity of the air which
    we meet with in these vast tracts of country, which are now properly
    denominated “the great buffalo plains,” a series of exceedingly
    elevated plateaus of <em>steppes</em> or <em>prairies</em>, lying at and
    near the base of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

  <p>It is a fact then, which I presume will be new to most of the world,
    that meat can be cured in the sun without the aid of smoke or salt;
    and it is a fact equally true and equally surprising also, that none
    of these tribes use salt in any way, although their country abounds
    in salt springs; and in many places, in the frequent walks of the
    Indian, the prairie may be seen, for miles together, covered with an
    incrustation of salt as white as the drifted snow.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

  <p>I have, in travelling with Indians, encamped by such places, where they
    have cooked and eaten their meat, when I have been unable to prevail on
    them to use salt in any quantity whatever. The Indians cook their meat
    more than the civilized people do, and I have long since learned, from
    necessity, that meat thus cooked can easily be eaten and relished too,
    without salt or other condiment.</p>

  <p>The fact above asserted applies exclusively to those tribes of Indians
    which I have found in their primitive state, living entirely on meat;
    but everywhere along our Frontier, where the game of the country
    has long since been chiefly destroyed, and these people have become
    semi-civilized, raising and eating, as we do, a variety of vegetable
    food, they use (and no doubt require), a great deal of salt; and in
    many instances use it even to destructive excess.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MANDAN VILLAGE, UPPER MISSOURI.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> Mandans, like all other tribes, lead lives of idleness and
    leisure; and of course, devote a great deal of time to their sports
    and amusements, of which they have a great variety. Of these, dancing
    is one of the principal, and may be seen in a variety of forms: such
    as the buffalo dance, the boasting dance, the begging dance, the scalp
    dance, and a dozen other kinds of dances, all of which have their
    peculiar characters and meanings or objects.</p>

  <p>These exercises are exceedingly grotesque in their appearance, and to
    the eye of a traveller who knows not their meaning or importance, they
    are an uncouth and frightful display of starts, and jumps, and yelps,
    and jarring gutturals, which are sometimes truly terrifying. But when
    one gives them a little attention, and has been lucky enough to be
    initiated into their mysterious meaning, they become a subject of the
    most intense and exciting interest. Every dance has its peculiar step,
    and every step has its meaning; every dance also has its peculiar song,
    and that is so intricate and mysterious oftentimes, that not one in ten
    of the young men who are dancing and singing it, know the meaning of
    the song which they are chanting over. None but the medicine-men are
    allowed to understand them; and even they are generally only initiated
    into these secret arcana, on the payment of a liberal stipend for their
    tuition, which requires much application and study. There is evidently
    a set song and sentiment for every dance, for the songs are perfectly
    measured, and sung in exact time with the beat of the drum; and always
    with an uniform and invariable set of sounds and expressions, which
    clearly indicate certain sentiments, which are expressed by the voice,
    though sometimes not given in any known language whatever.</p>

  <p>They have other dances and songs which are not so mystified, but which
    are sung and understood by every person in the tribe, being sung in
    their own language, with much poetry in them, and perfectly metred, but
    without rhyme. On these subjects I shall take another occasion to say
    more; and will for the present turn your attention to the style and
    modes in which some of these curious transactions are conducted.</p>

  <p>My ears have been almost continually ringing since I came here, with
    the din of yelping and beating of the drums; but I have for several
    days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span> past been peculiarly engrossed, and my senses almost confounded
    with the stamping, and grunting, and bellowing of the <em>buffalo
    dance</em>, which closed a few days since at sunrise (thank Heaven), and
    which I must needs describe to you.</p>

  <p>Buffaloes, it is known, are a sort of roaming creatures, congregating
    occasionally in huge masses, and strolling away about the country from
    east to west, or from north to south, or just where their whims or
    strange fancies may lead them; and the Mandans are sometimes, by this
    means, most unceremoniously left without any thing to eat; and being a
    small tribe, and unwilling to risk their lives by going far from home
    in the face of their more powerful enemies, are oftentimes left almost
    in a state of starvation. In any emergency of this kind, every man
    musters and brings out of his lodge his mask (the skin of a buffalo’s
    head with the horns on), which he is obliged to keep in readiness
    for this occasion; and then commences the buffalo dance, of which I
    have above spoken, which is held for the purpose of making “buffalo
    come” (as they term it), of inducing the buffalo herds to change the
    direction of their wanderings, and bend their course towards the Mandan
    village, and graze about on the beautiful hills and bluffs in its
    vicinity, where the Mandans can shoot them down and cook them as they
    want them for food.</p>

  <p>For the most part of the year, the young warriors and hunters, by
    riding out a mile or two from the village, can kill meat in abundance;
    and sometimes large herds of these animals may be seen grazing in
    full view of the village. There are other seasons also when the young
    men have ranged about the country as far as they are willing to risk
    their lives, on account of their enemies, without finding meat. This
    sad intelligence is brought back to the chiefs and doctors, who sit in
    solemn council, and consult on the most expedient measures to be taken,
    until they are sure to decide upon the old and only expedient which
    “never has failed.”</p>

  <p>The chief issues his order to his runners or criers, who proclaim it
    through the village—and in a few minutes the dance begins. The place
    where this strange operation is carried on is in the public area in the
    centre of the village, and in front of the great medicine or mystery
    lodge. About ten or fifteen Mandans at a time join in the dance, each
    one with the skin of the buffalo’s head (or mask) with the horns on,
    placed over his head, and in his hand his favourite bow or lance, with
    which he is used to slay the buffalo.</p>

  <p>I mentioned that this dance always had the desired effect, that it
    never fails, nor can it, for it cannot be stopped (but is going
    incessantly day and night) until “buffalo come.” Drums are beating and
    rattles are shaken, and songs and yells incessantly are shouted, and
    lookers-on stand ready with masks on their heads, and weapons in hand,
    to take the place of each one as he becomes fatigued, and jumps out of
    the ring.</p>

  <p>During this time of general excitement, spies or “<em>lookers</em>” are
    kept on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span> hills in the neighbourhood of the village, who, when they
    discover buffaloes in sight, give the appropriate signal, by “throwing
    their robes,” which is instantly seen in the village, and understood by
    the whole tribe. At this joyful intelligence there is a shout of thanks
    to the Great Spirit, and more especially to the mystery-man, and the
    dancers, <em>who have been the immediate cause of their success</em>!
    There is then a brisk preparation for the chase—a grand hunt takes
    place. The choicest pieces of the victims are sacrificed to the Great
    Spirit, and then a surfeit and a carouse.</p>

  <p>These dances have sometimes been continued in this village two and
    three weeks without stopping an instant, until the joyful moment when
    buffaloes made their appearance. So they <em>never fail</em>; and they
    think they have been the means of bringing them in.</p>

  <p>Every man in the Mandan village (as I have before said) is obliged by
    a village regulation, to keep the mask of the buffalo, hanging on a
    post at the head of his bed, which he can use on his head whenever he
    is called upon by the chiefs, to dance for the coming of buffaloes.
    The mask is put over the head, and generally has a strip of the skin
    hanging to it, of the whole length of the animal, with the tail
    attached to it, which, passing down over the back of the dancer, is
    dragging on the ground (<a href="#i_056"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 56</a>). When one becomes fatigued
    of the exercise, he signifies it by bending quite forward, and sinking
    his body towards the ground; when another draws a bow upon him and hits
    him with a blunt arrow, and he falls like a buffalo—is seized by the
    bye-standers, who drag him out of the ring by the heels, brandishing
    their knives about him; and having gone through the motions of skinning
    and cutting him up, they let him off, and his place is at once supplied
    by another, who dances into the ring with his mask on; and by this
    taking of places, the scene is easily kept up night and day, until the
    desired effect has been produced, that of “making buffalo come.”</p>

  <p>The day before yesterday however, readers, which, though it commenced
    in joy and thanksgiving to the Great Spirit for the signal success
    which had attended their several days of dancing and supplication,
    ended in a calamity which threw the village of the Mandans into
    mourning and repentant tears, and that at a time of scarcity and great
    distress. The signal was given into the village on that morning from
    the top of a distant bluff, that a band of buffaloes were in sight,
    though at a considerable distance off, and every heart beat with joy,
    and every eye watered and glistened with gladness.</p>

  <p>The dance had lasted some three or four days, and now, instead of the
    doleful tap of the drum and the begging chaunts of the dancers, the
    stamping of horses was heard as they were led and galloped through the
    village—young men were throwing off their robes and their shirts,—were
    seen snatching a handful of arrows from their quivers, and stringing
    their sinewy bows, glancing their eyes and their smiles at their
    sweethearts, and mounting their ponies. <span class="gesperrtstar">* * *</span></p>

  <p><span class="gesperrtstar">* *</span> A few minutes there had been of bustle and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span> boasting, whilst
    bows were twanging and spears were polishing by running their blades
    into the ground—every face and every eye was filled with joy and
    gladness—horses were pawing and snuffing in fury for the outset, when
    Louison Frénié, an interpreter of the Fur Company, galloped through the
    village with his rifle in his hand and his powder-horn at his side; his
    head and waist were bandaged with handkerchiefs, and his shirt sleeves
    rolled up to his shoulders—the hunter’s yell issued from his lips and
    was repeated through the village; he flew to the bluffs, and behind
    him and over the graceful swells of the prairie, galloped the emulous
    youths, whose hearts were beating high and quick for the onset.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>32</i></div>

    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_056.jpg" alt="" />
     <figcaption>56</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>In the village, where hunger had reigned, and starvation was almost
    ready to look them in the face, all was instantly turned to joy and
    gladness. The chiefs and doctors who had been for some days dealing
    out minimum rations to the community from the public crib, now spread
    before their subjects the contents of their own private <i lang="fr">caches</i>,
    and the last of every thing that could be mustered, that they might eat
    a thanksgiving to the Great Spirit for his goodness in sending them a
    supply of buffalo meat. A general carouse of banqueting ensued, which
    occupied the greater part of the day; and their hidden stores which
    might have fed an emergency for several weeks, were pretty nearly used
    up on the occasion—bones were half picked, and dishes half emptied and
    then handed to the dogs. <em>I</em> was not forgotten neither, in the
    general surfeit; several large and generous wooden bowls of pemican and
    other palatable food were sent to my painting-room, and I received them
    in this time of scarcity with great pleasure.</p>

  <p>After this general indulgence was over, and the dogs had licked the
    dishes, their usual games and amusements ensued—and hilarity and mirth,
    and joy took possession of, and reigned in, every nook and corner of
    the village; and in the midst of this, screams and shrieks were heard!
    and echoed everywhere. Women and children scrambled to the tops of
    their wigwams, with their eyes and their hands stretched in agonizing
    earnestness to the prairie, whilst blackened warriors ran furiously
    through every winding maze of the village, and issuing their jarring
    gutturals of vengeance, as they snatched their deadly weapons from
    their lodges, and struck the reddened post as they furiously passed
    it by! Two of their hunters were bending their course down the sides
    of the bluff towards the village, and another broke suddenly out of a
    deep ravine, and yet another was seen dashing over and down the green
    hills, and all were goading on their horses at full speed! and then
    came another, and another, and all entered the village amid shouts and
    groans of the villagers who crowded around them; the story was told
    in their looks, for one was bleeding, and the blood that flowed from
    his naked breast had crimsoned his milk white steed as it had dripped
    over him; another grasped in his left hand a scalp that was reeking in
    blood—and in the other his whip—another grasped nothing, save the reins
    in one hand and the mane of the horse in the other, having thrown his
    bow and his arrows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> away, and trusted to the fleetness of his horse
    for his safety; yet the story was audibly told, and the fatal tragedy
    recited in irregular and almost suffocating ejaculations—the names
    of the dead were in turns pronounced and screams and shrieks burst
    forth at their recital—murmurs and groans ran through the village, and
    this happy little community were in a moment smitten with sorrow and
    distraction.</p>

  <p>Their proud band of hunters who had started full of glee and mirth in
    the morning, had been surrounded by their enemy, the Sioux, and eight
    of them killed. The Sioux, who had probably reconnoitred their village
    during the night, and ascertained that they were dancing for buffaloes,
    laid a stratagem to entrap them in the following manner:—Some six
    or eight of them appeared the next morning (on a distant bluff, in
    sight of their sentinel) under the skins of buffaloes, imitating the
    movements of those animals whilst grazing; and being discovered by
    the sentinel, the intelligence was telegraphed to the village, which
    brought out their hunters as I have described. The masked buffaloes
    were seen grazing on the top of a high bluff, and when the hunters had
    approached within half a mile or so of them, they suddenly disappeared
    over the hill. Louison Frénié, who was leading the little band of
    hunters, became at that moment suspicious of so strange a movement, and
    came to a halt <span class="gesperrtstar">* * *</span></p>

  <p>* “Look”! (said a Mandan, pointing to a little ravine to the right, and
    at the foot of the hill, from which suddenly broke some forty or fifty
    furious Sioux, on fleet horses and under full whip, who were rushing
    upon them); they wheeled, and in front of them came another band more
    furious from the other side of the hill! they started for home (poor
    fellows), and strained every nerve; but the Sioux were too fleet for
    them; and every now and then, the whizzing arrow and the lance were
    heard to rip the flesh of their naked backs, and a grunt and a groan,
    as they tumbled from their horses. Several miles were run in this
    desperate race; and Frénié got home, and several of the Mandans, though
    eight of them were killed and scalped by the way.</p>

  <p>So ended that day and the hunt; but many a day and sad, will last the
    grief of those whose hearts were broken on that unlucky occasion.</p>

  <p><em>This</em> day, though, my readers, has been one of a more joyful
    kind, for the Great Spirit, who was indignant at so flagrant an
    injustice, has sent the Mandans an abundance of buffaloes; and all
    hearts have joined in a general thanksgiving to Him for his goodness
    and justice.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MANDAN VILLAGE, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">In</span> my last Letter I gave an account of the buffalo dance, and in future
    epistles may give some descriptions of a dozen other kinds of dance,
    which these people have in common with other tribes; but in the present
    Letter I shall make an endeavour to confine my observations to several
    other customs and forms, which are very curious and peculiar to the
    Mandans.</p>

  <p>Of these, one of the most pleasing is the <em>sham-fight</em> and sham
    scalp-dance of the Mandan boys, which is a part of their regular
    exercise, and constitutes a material branch of their education.
    During the pleasant mornings of the summer, the little boys between
    the age of seven and fifteen are called out, to the number of several
    hundred, and being divided into two companies, each of which is headed
    by some experienced warrior, who leads them on, in the character of
    a teacher; they are led out into the prairie at sunrise, where this
    curious discipline is regularly taught them (<a href="#i_057"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 57</a>). Their
    bodies are naked, and each one has a little bow in his left hand and
    a number of arrows made of large spears of grass, which are harmless
    in their effects. Each one has also a little belt or girdle around
    his waist, in which he carries a knife made of a piece of wood and
    equally harmless—on the tops of their heads are slightly attached
    small tufts of grass, which answer as scalps, and in this plight,
    they follow the dictates of their experienced leaders, who lead them
    through the judicious evolutions of Indian warfare—of feints—of
    retreats—of attacks—and at last to a general fight. Many manœuvres are
    gone through, and eventually they are brought up face to face, within
    fifteen or twenty feet of each other, with their leaders at their head
    stimulating them on. Their bows are bent upon each other and their
    missiles flying, whilst they are dodging and fending them off.</p>

  <p>If any one is struck with an arrow on any vital part of his body, he is
    obliged to fall, and his adversary rushes up to him, places his foot
    upon him, and snatching from his belt his wooden knife, grasps hold of
    his victim’s scalp-lock of grass, and making a feint at it with his
    wooden knife, twitches it off and puts it into his belt, and enters
    again into the ranks and front of battle.</p>

  <p>This mode of training generally lasts an hour or more in the morning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
    and is performed on an empty stomach, affording them a rigid and
    wholesome exercise, whilst they are instructed in the important science
    of war. Some five or six miles of ground are run over during these
    evolutions, giving suppleness to their limbs and strength to their
    muscles, which last and benefit them through life.</p>

  <p>After this exciting exhibition is ended, they all return to their
    village, where the chiefs and braves pay profound attention to their
    vaunting, and applaud them for their artifice and valour.</p>

  <p>Those who have taken scalps then step forward, brandishing them and
    making their boast as they enter into the <em>scalp-dance</em> (in which
    they are also instructed by their leaders or teachers), jumping and
    yelling—brandishing their scalps, and reciting their <em>sanguinary
    deeds</em>, to the great astonishment of their tender aged sweethearts,
    who are gazing with wonder upon them.</p>

  <p>The games and amusements of these people are in most respects like
    those of the other tribes, consisting of ball plays—game of the
    moccasin, of the platter—feats of archery—horse-racing, &amp;c.; and they
    have yet another, which may be said to be their favourite amusement,
    and unknown to the other tribes about them. The game of Tchung-kee, a
    beautiful athletic exercise, which they seem to be almost unceasingly
    practicing whilst the weather is fair, and they have nothing else
    of moment to demand their attention. This game is decidedly their
    favourite amusement, and is played near to the village on a pavement
    of clay, which has been used for that purpose until it has become as
    smooth and hard as a floor. For this game two champions form their
    respective parties, by choosing alternately the most famous players,
    until their requisite numbers are made up. Their bettings are then
    made, and their stakes are held by some of the chiefs or others
    present. The play commences (<a href="#i_059"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 59</a>) with two (one from each
    party), who start off upon a trot, abreast of each other, and one of
    them rolls in advance of them, on the pavement, a little ring of two
    or three inches in diameter, cut out of a stone; and each one follows
    it up with his “tchung-kee” (a stick of six feet in length, with
    little bits of leather projecting from its sides of an inch or more in
    length), which he throws before him as he runs, sliding it along upon
    the ground after the ring, endeavouring to place it in such a position
    when it stops, that the ring may fall upon it, and receive one of the
    little projections of leather through it, which counts for game, one,
    or two, or four, according to the position of the leather on which the
    ring is lodged. The last winner always has the rolling of the ring,
    and both start and throw the tchung-kee together; if either fails to
    receive the ring or to lie in a certain position, it is a forfeiture
    of the amount of the number he was nearest to, and he loses his throw;
    when another steps into his place. This game is a very difficult one
    to describe, so as to give an exact idea of it, unless one can see it
    played—it is a game of great beauty and fine bodily exercise, and these
    people become excessively fascinated with it; often gambling away every
    thing they possess, and even sometimes, when everything else was gone,
    have been known to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span> stake their liberty upon the issue of these games,
    offering themselves as slaves to their opponents in case they get
    beaten.</p>

  <p><em>Feasting</em> and <em>fasting</em> are important customs observed by
    the Mandans, as well as by most other tribes, at stated times and for
    particular purposes. These observances are strictly religious and
    rigidly observed. There are many of these forms practiced amongst the
    Mandans, some of which are exceedingly interesting, and important also,
    in forming a correct estimate of the Indian character; and I shall at a
    future period take particular pains to lay them before my readers.</p>

  <p><em>Sacrificing</em> is also a religious custom with these people, and
    is performed in many different modes, and on numerous occasions. Of
    this custom I shall also speak more fully hereafter, merely noticing
    at present, some few of the hundred modes in which these offerings
    are made to the Good and Evil Spirits. Human sacrifices have never
    been made by the Mandans, nor by any of the north western tribes (so
    far as I can learn), excepting the Pawnees of the Platte; who have,
    undoubtedly, observed such an inhuman practice in former times, though
    they have relinquished it of late. The Mandans sacrifice their fingers
    to the Great Spirit, and of their worldly goods, the best and the most
    costly; if a horse or a dog, it must be the favourite one; if it is
    an arrow from their quiver, they will select the most perfect one as
    the most effective gift; if it is meat, it is the choicest piece cut
    from the buffalo or other animal; if it is anything from the stores of
    the Traders, it is the most costly—it is blue or scarlet cloth, which
    costs them in this country an enormous price, and is chiefly used for
    the purpose of hanging over their wigwams to decay, or to cover the
    scaffolds where rest the bones of their departed relations.</p>

  <p>Of these kinds of sacrifices there are three of an interesting nature,
    erected over the great medicine-lodge in the centre of the village—they
    consist of ten or fifteen yards of blue and black cloth each, purchased
    from the Fur Company at fifteen or twenty dollars per yard, which
    are folded up so as to resemble human figures, with quills in their
    heads and masks on their faces. These singular-looking figures, like
    “<em>scare crows</em>” (<a href="#i_047"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 47</a>), are erected on poles about
    thirty feet high, over the door of the mystery-lodge, and there are
    left to decay. There hangs now by the side of them another, which was
    added to the number a few days since, of the skin of a white buffalo,
    which will remain there until it decays and falls to pieces.</p>

  <p>This beautiful and costly skin, when its history is known, will
    furnish a striking proof of the importance which they attach to these
    propitiatory offerings. But a few weeks since, a party of Mandans
    returned from the Mouth of the Yellow Stone, two hundred miles
    above, with information that a party of Blackfeet were visiting that
    place on business with the American Fur Company; and that they had
    with them a white buffalo robe for sale. This was looked upon as a
    subject of great importance by the chiefs, and one worthy of public
    consideration. A white buffalo robe is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span> great curiosity, even in the
    country of buffaloes, and will always command an almost incredible
    price, from its extreme scarcity; and then, from its being the most
    costly article of traffic in these regions, it is usually converted
    into a <em>sacrifice</em>, being offered to the Great Spirit, as the
    most acceptable gift that can be procured. Amongst the vast herds of
    buffaloes which graze on these boundless prairies, there is not one in
    an hundred thousand, perhaps, that is white; and when such an one is
    obtained, it is considered great <em>medicine</em> or mystery.</p>

  <p>On the receipt of the intelligence above-mentioned, the chiefs convened
    in council, and deliberated on the expediency of procuring the white
    robe from the Blackfeet; and also of appropriating the requisite means,
    and devising the proper mode of procedure for effecting the purchase.
    At the close of their deliberations, eight men were fitted out on eight
    of their best horses, who took from the Fur Company’s store, on the
    credit of the chiefs, goods exceeding even the value of their eight
    horses; and they started for the Mouth of the Yellow Stone, where
    they arrived in due time, and made the purchase, by leaving the eight
    horses and all the goods which they carried; returning on foot to their
    own village, bringing home with them the white robe, which was looked
    upon by all eyes of the villagers as a thing that was vastly curious,
    and containing (as they express it) something of the Great Spirit.
    This wonderful anomaly laid several days in the chief’s lodge, until
    public curiosity was gratified; and then it was taken by the doctors or
    high-priests, and with a great deal of form and mystery consecrated,
    and raised on the top of a long pole over the <em>medicine-lodge</em>;
    where it now stands in a group with the others, and will stand as an
    offering to the Great Spirit, until it decays and falls to the ground.</p>

  <p>This Letter, as I promised in its commencement, being devoted to some
    of the customs peculiar to the Mandans, and all of which will be new
    to the world, I shall close, after recording in it an account of a
    laughable farce, which was enacted in this village when I was on my
    journey up the river, and had stopped on the way to spend a day or two
    in the Mandan village.</p>

  <p>Readers, did you ever hear of “<em>Rain Makers</em>?” If not, sit still,
    and read on; but laugh not—keep cool and sober, or else you may laugh
    in the <em>beginning</em>, and cry at the <em>end</em> of my story.
    Well, I introduce to you a new character—not a <em>doctor</em> or a
    <em>high-priest</em>, yet a <em>medicine-man</em>, and one of the highest
    and most respectable order, a “<em>Rain Maker</em>!” Such dignitaries
    live in the Mandan nation, aye, and “<em>rain stoppers</em>” too; and
    even those also amongst their <em>conjurati</em>, who, like Joshua of
    old, have even essayed to stop the sun in his course; but from the
    inefficiency of their medicine or mystery, have long since descended
    into insignificance.</p>

  <p>Well, the story begins thus:—The Mandans, as I have said in a former
    Letter, raise a great deal of corn; and sometimes a most disastrous
    drought will be visited on the land, destructive to their promised
    harvest. Such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span> was the case when I arrived at the Mandan village
    on the steam-boat, Yellow-Stone. Rain had not fallen for many a day,
    and the dear little girls and the ugly old squaws, altogether (all of
    whom had fields of corn), were groaning and crying to their lords, and
    imploring them to intercede for rain, that their little respective
    patches, which were now turning pale and yellow, might not be withered,
    and they be deprived of the pleasure of their customary annual
    festivity, and the joyful occasion of the “roasting ears,” and the
    “green corn dance.”</p>

  <p>The chiefs and doctors sympathized with the plaints of the women, and
    recommended patience. Great deliberation, they said, was necessary in
    these cases; and though they resolved on making the attempt to produce
    rain for the benefit of the corn; yet they very wisely resolved that
    to begin too soon might ensure their entire defeat in the endeavour;
    and that the longer they put it off, the more certain they would feel
    of ultimate success. So, after a few days of further delay, when the
    importunities of the women had become clamorous, and even mournful,
    and almost insupportable, the <em>medicine-men</em> assembled in the
    council-house, with all their mystery apparatus about them—with an
    abundance of wild sage, and other aromatic herbs, with a fire prepared
    to burn them, that their savoury odours might be sent forth to the
    Great Spirit. The lodge was closed to all the villagers, except some
    ten or fifteen young men, who were willing to hazard the dreadful
    alternative of making it rain, or suffer the everlasting disgrace of
    having made a fruitless essay.</p>

  <p>They, only, were allowed as witnesses to the <em>hocus pocus</em> and
    <em>conjuration</em> devised by the doctors inside of the medicine-lodge;
    and they were called up by lot, each one in his turn, to spend a day
    upon the top of the lodge, to test the potency of his medicine; or, in
    other words, to see how far his voice might be heard and obeyed amongst
    the clouds of the heavens; whilst the doctors were burning incense in
    the wigwam below, and with their songs and prayers to the Great Spirit
    for success, were sending forth grateful fumes and odours to Him “who
    lives in the sun and commands the thunders of Heaven.” Wah-kee (the
    shield) was the first who ascended the wigwam at sunrise; and he stood
    all day, and looked foolish, as he was counting over and over his
    string of mystery-beads—the whole village were assembled around him,
    and praying for his success. Not a cloud appeared—the day was calm and
    hot; and at the setting of the sun, he descended from the lodge and
    went home—“his <em>medicine</em> was not good,” nor can he ever be a
    <em>medicine-man</em>.</p>

  <p>Om-pah (the elk) was the next; he ascended the lodge at sunrise the
    next morning. His body was entirely naked, being covered with yellow
    clay. On his left arm he carried a beautiful shield, and a long lance
    in his right; and on his head the skin of a raven, the bird that soars
    amidst the clouds, and above the lightning’s glare—he flourished his
    shield and brandished his lance, and raised his voice, but in vain; for
    at sunset the ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span> was dry and the sky was clear; the squaws were
    crying, and their corn was withering at its roots.</p>

  <p>War-rah-pa (the beaver) was the next; he also spent his breath in vain
    upon the empty air, and came down at night—and Wak-a-dah-ha-hee (the
    white buffalo’s hair) took the stand the next morning. He is a small,
    but beautifully proportioned young man. He was dressed in a tunic and
    leggings of the skins of the mountain-sheep, splendidly garnished
    with quills of the porcupine, and fringed with locks of hair taken
    by his own hand from the heads of his enemies. On his arm he carried
    his shield, made of the buffalo’s hide—its boss was the head of the
    war-eagle—and its front was ornamented with “red chains of lightning.”
    In his left hand he clenched his sinewy bow and one single arrow. The
    villagers were all gathered about him; when he threw up a feather to
    decide on the course of the wind, and he commenced thus:—“My friends!
    people of the pheasants! you see me here a sacrifice—I shall this
    day relieve you from great distress, and bring joy amongst you; or I
    shall descend from this lodge when the sun goes down, and live amongs
    the dogs and old women all my days. My friends! you saw which way the
    feather flew, and I hold my shield this day in the direction where the
    wind comes—the lightning on my shield will draw a great cloud, and this
    arrow, which is selected from my quiver, and which is feathered with
    the quill of the white swan, will make a hole in it. My friends! this
    hole in the lodge at my feet, shows me the medicine-men, who are seated
    in the lodge below me and crying to the Great Spirit; and through it
    comes and passes into my nose delightful odours, which you see rising
    in the smoke to the Great Spirit above, who rides in the clouds and
    commands the winds! Three days they have sat here, my friends, and
    nothing has been done to relieve your distress. On the first day was
    Wah-kee (the shield), he could do nothing; he counted his beads and
    came down—his medicine was not good—his name was bad, and it kept off
    the rain. The next was Om-pah (the elk); on his head the raven was
    seen, who flies <em>above</em> the storm, and he failed. War-rah-pa (the
    beaver) was the next, my friends; the beaver lives <em>under</em> the
    <em>water</em>, and he never wants it to rain. My friends! I see you are
    in great distress, and nothing has yet been done; this shield belonged
    to my father the White Buffalo; and the lightning you see on it is
    red; it was taken from a black cloud, and that cloud will come over us
    to-day. I am the white buffalo’s hair—and I am the son of my father.”</p>

  <p>In this manner flourished and manœuvred Wak-a-dah-ha-hee (the white
    buffalo’s hair), alternately addressing the audience and the heaven—and
    holding converse with the winds and the “<i lang="mhq">je-bi</i>” (spirits) that
    are floating about in them—stamping his foot over the heads of the
    <em>magi</em>, who were involved in mysteries beneath him, and invoking
    the spirits of darkness and light to send rain, to gladden the hearts
    of the Mandans.</p>

  <p>It happened on this memorable day about noon, that the steam-boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
    Yellow Stone, on her first trip up the Missouri River, approached and
    landed at the Mandan Village, as I have described in a former epistle.
    I was lucky enough to be a passenger on this boat, and helped to fire
    a salute of twenty guns of twelve pounds calibre, when we first came
    in sight of the village, some three or four miles below. These guns
    introduced a <em>new sound</em> into this strange country, which the
    Mandans at first supposed to be thunder; and the young man upon the
    lodge, who turned it to good account, was gathering fame in rounds of
    applause, which were repeated and echoed through the whole village;
    all eyes were centred upon him—chiefs envied him—mothers’ hearts
    were beating high whilst they were decorating and leading up their
    fair daughters to offer him in marriage, on his signal success. The
    medicine-men had left the lodge, and came out to bestow upon him the
    envied title of “<em>medicine-man</em>,” or “<em>doctor</em>,” which he
    had so deservedly won—wreaths were prepared to decorate his brows, and
    eagle’s plumes and calumets were in readiness for him; his friends were
    all rejoiced—his enemies wore on their faces a silent gloom and hatred;
    and his old sweethearts, who had formerly cast him off, gazed intensely
    upon him, as they glowed with the burning fever of repentance.</p>

  <p>During all this excitement, Wak-a-dah-ha-hee kept his position,
    assuming the most commanding and threatening attitudes; brandishing his
    shield in the direction of the thunder (<a href="#i_058"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 58</a>), although
    there was not a cloud to be seen, until he (poor fellow), being
    elevated above the rest of the village, espied, to his inexpressible
    amazement, the steam-boat ploughing its way up the windings of the
    river below; puffing her steam from her pipes, and sending forth the
    thunder from a twelve-pounder on her deck! <span class="gesperrtstar">* * *</span> The White Buffalo’s
    Hair stood motionless and turned pale, he looked awhile, and turned to
    the chief and to the multitude, and addressed them with a trembling
    lip—“My friends, we will get no rain!—there are, you see, no clouds;
    but my medicine is great—I have brought a <em>thunder boat</em>! look and
    see it! the thunder you hear is out of her mouth, and the lightning
    which you see is on the waters!”</p>

  <p>At this intelligence, the whole village flew to the tops of their
    wigwams, or to the bank of the river, from whence the steamer was in
    full view, and ploughing along, to their utter dismay and confusion.</p>

  <p>In this promiscuous throng of chiefs, doctors, women, children and
    dogs, was mingled Wak-a-dah-ha-hee (the white buffalo’s hair), having
    descended from his high place to mingle with the frightened throng.</p>

  <p>Dismayed at the approach of so strange and unaccountable an object, the
    Mandans stood their ground but a few moments; when, by an order of the
    chiefs, all hands were ensconced within the piquets of their village,
    and all the warriors armed for desperate defence. A few moments brought
    the boat in front of the village, and all was still and quiet as death;
    not a Mandan was to be seen upon the banks. The steamer was moored, and
    three or four of the chiefs soon after, walked boldly down the bank and
    on to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span> deck, with a spear in one hand and the calumet or pipe of
    peace in the other. The moment they stepped on board they met (to their
    great surprise and joy) their old friend, Major Sanford, their agent,
    which circumstance put an instant end to all their fears. The villagers
    were soon apprized of the fact, and the whole race of the beautiful and
    friendly Mandans was paraded on the bank of the river, in front of the
    steamer.</p>

  <p>The “rain maker,” whose apprehensions of a public calamity brought
    upon the nation by his extraordinary <em>medicine</em>, had, for the
    better security of his person from apprehended vengeance, secreted
    himself in some secure place, and was the last to come forward, and the
    last to be convinced that this visitation was a friendly one from the
    white people; and that his <em>medicine</em> had not in the least been
    instrumental in bringing it about. This information, though received
    by him with much caution and suspicion, at length gave him great
    relief, and quieted his mind as to his danger. Yet still in his breast
    there was a rankling thorn, though he escaped the dreaded vengeance
    which he had a few moments before apprehended as at hand; as he had
    the mortification and disgrace of having failed in his mysterious
    operations. He set up, however (during the day, in his conversation
    about the strange arrival), his <em>medicines</em>, as the cause of
    its approach; asserting everywhere and to everybody, that he knew
    of its coming, and that he had by his magic brought the occurrence
    about. This plea, however, did not get him much audience; and in fact,
    everything else was pretty much swallowed up in the guttural talk, and
    bustle, and gossip about the mysteries of the “thunder-boat;” and so
    passed the day, until just at the approach of evening, when the “White
    Buffalo’s Hair” (more watchful of such matters on this occasion than
    most others) observed that a black cloud had been jutting up in the
    horizon, and was almost directly over the village! In an instant his
    shield was on his arm, and his bow in his hand, and he again upon the
    lodge! stiffened and braced to the last sinew, he stood, with his face
    and his shield presented to the cloud, and his bow drawn. He drew the
    eyes of the whole village upon him as he vaunted forth his super-human
    powers, and at the same time commanding the cloud to come nearer, that
    he might draw down its contents upon the heads and the corn-fields of
    the Mandans! In this wise he stood, waving his shield over his head,
    stamping his foot and frowning as he drew his bow and threatened the
    heavens, commanding it to rain—his bow was bent, and the arrow drawn
    to its head, was sent to the cloud, and he exclaimed, “My friends, it
    is done! Wak-a-dah-ha-hee’s arrow has entered that black cloud, and
    the Mandans will be wet with the water of the skies!” His predictions
    were true;—in a few moments the cloud was over the village, and the
    rain fell in torrents. He stood for some time wielding his weapons and
    presenting his shield to the sky, while he boasted of his power and
    the efficacy of his <em>medicine</em>, to those who had been about him,
    but were now driven to the shelter of their wigwams. He, at length,
    finished his vaunts and his threats, and descended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span> from his high place
    (in which he had been perfectly drenched), prepared to receive the
    honours and the homage that were due to one so potent in his mysteries;
    and to receive the style and title of “<em>medicine-man</em>.” This is
    one of a hundred different modes in which a man in Indian countries
    acquires the honourable appellation.</p>

  <p>This man had “made it rain,” and of course was to receive more than
    usual honours, as he had done much more than ordinary men could do.
    All eyes were upon him, and all were ready to admit that he was
    skilled in the magic art; and must be so nearly allied to the Great
    or Evil Spirit, that he must needs be a man of great and powerful
    influence in the nation, and well entitled to the style of doctor or
    <em>medicine-man</em>.</p>

  <p>Readers, there are two facts relative to these strange transactions,
    which are infallibly true, and should needs be made known. The first
    is, that when the Mandans undertake to make it rain, <em>they never
    fail to succeed</em>, for their ceremonies never stop until rain begins
    to fall. The second is equally true, and is this:—that he who has
    once “<em>made it rain</em>,” never attempts it again; his medicine is
    undoubted—and on future occasions of the kind, he stands aloof, who has
    once done it in presence of the whole village, giving an opportunity to
    other young men who are ambitious to signalize themselves in the same
    way.</p>

  <p>During the memorable night of which I have just spoken, the steam-boat
    remained by the side of the Mandan village, and the rain that had
    commenced falling continued to pour down its torrents until midnight;
    black thunder roared, and livid lightning flashed until the heavens
    appeared to be lit up with one unceasing and appalling glare. In
    this frightful moment of consternation, a flash of lightning buried
    itself in one of the earth-covered lodges of the Mandans, and killed a
    beautiful girl. Here was food and fuel fresh for their superstitions;
    and a night of vast tumult and excitement ensued. The dreams of the
    new-made medicine-man were troubled, and he had dreadful apprehensions
    for the coming day—for he knew that he was subject to the irrevocable
    decree of the chiefs and doctors, who canvass every strange and
    unaccountable event, with close and superstitious scrutiny, and let
    their vengeance fall without mercy upon its immediate cause.</p>

  <p>He looked upon his well-earned fame as likely to be withheld from him;
    and also considered that his life might perhaps be demanded as the
    forfeit for this girl’s death, which would certainly be charged upon
    him. He looked upon himself as culpable, and supposed the accident
    to have been occasioned by his criminal desertion of his post, when
    the steam-boat was approaching the village. Morning came, and he soon
    learned from some of his friends, the opinions of the wise men; and
    also the nature of the tribunal that was preparing for him; he sent
    to the prairie for his three horses, which were brought in, and he
    mounted the <em>medicine-lodge</em>, around which, in a few moments, the
    villagers were all assembled. “My friends! (said he) I see you all
    around me, and I am before you; my medicine, you see, is great—it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
    <em>too great</em>—I am young, and I was too fast—I knew not when to
    stop. The wigwam of Mah-sish is laid low, and many are the eyes that
    weep for Ko-ka (the antelope;) Wak-a-dah-ha-hee gives three horses
    to gladden the hearts of those who weep for Ko-ka; his medicine was
    great—his arrow pierced the black cloud, and the lightning came, and
    the <em>thunder-boat</em> also! who says the medicine of Wak-a-dah-ha-hee
    is not strong?”</p>

  <p>At the end of this sentence an unanimous shout of approbation ran
    through the crowd, and the “Hair of the White Buffalo” descended
    amongst them, where he was greeted by shakes of the hand; and amongst
    whom he now lives and thrives under the familiar and honourable
    appellation of the “<span class="smcap">Big Double Medicine</span>.”</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MANDAN VILLAGE, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">This</span> day has been one of unusual mirth and amusement amongst the
    Mandans, and whether on account of some annual celebration or not, I
    am as yet unable to say, though I think such is the case; for these
    people have many days which, like this, are devoted to festivities and
    amusements.</p>

  <p>Their lives, however, are lives of idleness and ease, and almost all
    their days and hours are spent in innocent amusements. Amongst a people
    who have no office hours to attend to—no professions to study, and of
    whom but very little time is required in the chase, to supply their
    families with food, it would be strange if they did not practice many
    games and amusements, and also become exceedingly expert in them.</p>

  <p>I have this day been a spectator of games and plays until I am fatigued
    with looking on; and also by lending a hand, which I have done; but
    with so little success as only to attract general observation, and
    as generally to excite the criticisms and laughter of the squaws and
    little children.</p>

  <p>I have seen a fair exhibition of their archery this day, in a favourite
    amusement which they call the “<em>game of the arrow</em>” (see <a href="#i_060"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    60</a>), where the young men who are the most distinguished in
    this exercise, assemble on the prairie at a little distance from
    the village, and having paid, each one, his “entrance-fee,” such as
    a shield, a robe, a pipe, or other article, step forward in turn,
    shooting their arrows into the air, endeavouring to see who can get the
    greatest number flying in the air at one time, thrown from the same
    bow. For this, the number of eight or ten arrows are clenched in the
    left hand with the bow, and the first one which is thrown is elevated
    to such a degree as will enable it to remain the longest time possible
    in the air, and while it is flying, the others are discharged as
    rapidly as possible; and he who succeeds in getting the greatest number
    up at once, is “best,” and takes the goods staked.</p>

  <p>In looking on at this amusement, the spectator is surprised; not at
    the great distance to which the arrows are actually sent; but at
    the quickness of fixing them on the string, and discharging them in
    succession; which is no doubt, the result of great practice, and
    enables the most expert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span> of them to get as many as eight arrows up
    before the first one reaches the ground.</p>

  <p>For the successful use of the bow, as it is used through all this
    region of country on horseback, and that invariably at full speed, the
    great object of practice is to enable the bowman to draw the bow with
    suddenness and instant effect; and also to repeat the shots in the most
    rapid manner. As their game is killed from their horses’ backs while
    at the swiftest rate—and their enemies fought in the same way; and as
    the horse is the swiftest animal of the prairie, and always able to
    bring his rider alongside, within a few paces of his victim; it will
    easily be seen that the Indian has little use in throwing his arrow
    more than a few paces; when he leans quite low on his horse’s side, and
    drives it with astonishing force, capable of producing instant death
    to the buffalo, or any other animal in the country. The bows which are
    generally in use in these regions I have described in a former Letter,
    and the effects produced by them at the distance of a few paces is
    almost beyond belief, considering their length, which is not often over
    three,—and sometimes not exceeding two and a half feet. It can easily
    be seen, from what has been said, that the Indian has little use or
    object in throwing the arrow to any great distance. And as it is very
    seldom that they can be seen shooting at a target, I doubt very much
    whether their skill in such practice would compare with that attained
    to in many parts of the civilized world; but with the same weapon,
    and dashing forward at fullest speed on the wild horse, without the
    use of the rein, when the shot is required to be made with the most
    instantaneous effect, I scarcely think it possible that any people can
    be found more skilled, and capable of producing more deadly effects
    with the bow.</p>

  <p>The horses which the Indians ride in this country are invariably the
    wild horses, which are found in great numbers on the prairies; and
    have, unquestionably, strayed from the Mexican borders, into which they
    were introduced by the Spanish invaders of that country; and now range
    and subsist themselves, in winter and summer, over the vast plains of
    prairie that stretch from the Mexican frontiers to Lake Winnipeg on
    the North, a distance of 3000 miles. These horses are all of small
    stature, of the pony order; but a very hardy and tough animal, being
    able to perform for the Indians a continual and essential service.
    They are taken with the <em>laso</em>, which is a long halter or thong,
    made of rawhide, of some fifteen or twenty yards in length, and which
    the Indians throw with great dexterity; with a noose at one end of it,
    which drops over the head of the animal they wish to catch, whilst
    running at full speed—when the Indian dismounts from his own horse, and
    holding to the end of the laso, choaks the animal down, and afterwards
    tames and converts him to his own use.</p>

  <p>Scarcely a man in these regions is to be found, who is not the owner of
    one or more of these horses; and in many instances of eight, ten, or
    even twenty, which he values as his own personal property.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

  <p>The Indians are hard and cruel masters; and, added to their cruelties
    is the sin that is familiar in the Christian world, of sporting with
    the limbs, and the lives of these noble animals. <em>Horse-racing</em>
    here, as in all more enlightened communities, is one of the most
    exciting amusements, and one of the most extravagant modes of gambling.</p>

  <p>I have been this day a spectator to scenes of this kind, which have
    been enacted in abundance, on a course which they have, just back of
    their village; and although I never had the least taste for this cruel
    amusement in my own country, yet, I must say, I have been not a little
    amused and pleased with the thrilling effect which these exciting
    scenes have produced amongst so wild and picturesque a group.</p>

  <p>I have made a sketch of the ground and the group, as near as I could
    (<a href="#i_061"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 61</a>); shewing the manner of “starting” and “coming out,”
    which vary a little from the customs of the <em>knowing</em> world; but
    in other respects, I believe, a horse-race is the same all the world
    over.</p>

  <p>Besides these, many have been the amusements of this day, to which I
    have been an eye-witness; and since writing the above, I have learned
    the cause of this unusual expression of hilarity and mirth; which was
    no more nor less than the safe return of a small war-party, who had
    been so long out without any tidings having been received of them—that
    they had long since been looked upon as sacrificed to the fates of
    war and lost. This party was made up of the most distinguished and
    desperate young men of the tribe, who had sallied out against the
    Riccarees, and taken the most solemn oath amongst themselves never
    to return without achieving a victory. They had wandered long and
    faithfully about the country, following the trails of their enemy; when
    they were attacked by a numerous party, and lost several of their men
    and all their horses. In this condition, to evade the scrutiny of their
    enemy, who were closely investing the natural route to their village;
    they took a circuitous range of the country, to enable them to return
    with their lives, to their village.</p>

  <p>In this plight, it seems, I had dropped my little canoe alongside of
    them, while descending from the Mouth of Yellow Stone to this place,
    not many weeks since; where they had bivouacked or halted, to smoke
    and consult on the best and safest mode of procedure. At the time of
    meeting them, not knowing anything of their language, they were unable
    to communicate their condition to me, and more probably were afraid
    to do so even if they could have done it, from apprehension that we
    might have given some account of them to their enemies. I rested my
    canoe an hour or so with them, during which time they treated us with
    an indifferent reserve, yet respectfully; and we passed on our way,
    without further information of them or their plans than the sketch that
    I there made (<a href="#i_063"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 63</a>), and which I shall preserve and value
    as one of the most pleasing groups I ever have had the pleasure to see.
    Seated on their buffalo robes, which were spread upon the grass, with
    their respective weapons laying about them, and lighting their pipes at
    a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> little fire which was kindled in the centre—the chief or leader of
    the party, with his arms stacked behind him, and his long head-dress of
    war-eagles’ quills and ermine falling down over his back, whilst he sat
    in a contemplative and almost desponding mood, was surely one of the
    most striking and beautiful illustrations of a natural hero that I ever
    looked upon.</p>

  <p>These gallant fellows got safely home to their village, and the
    numerous expressions of joy for their return, which I have this day
    witnessed, have much fatigued me that I write brief, and close my
    Letter here.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MANDAN VILLAGE, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">In</span> a former Letter I gave some account of Mah-to-toh-pa (the four
    bears), second chief of the Mandans, whom I said I had painted at
    full length, in a splendid costume. I therein said, also, that “this
    extraordinary man, though second in office, is undoubtedly the first
    and most popular man in the nation. Free, generous, elegant, and
    gentlemanly in his deportment—handsome, brave and valiant; wearing a
    robe on his back, with the history of all his battles painted on it,
    which would fill a book of themselves if they were properly enlarged
    and translated.”</p>

  <p>I gave you also, in another epistle, an account of the manner in
    which he invited me to a feast in his hospitable wigwam, at the same
    time presenting me a beautifully garnished robe; and I promised to
    say more of him on a future occasion. My readers will therefore
    pardon me for devoting a Letter or two at this time, to a sketch of
    this extraordinary man, which I will give in as brief a manner as
    possible, by describing the costume in which I painted his portrait;
    and afterwards reciting the most remarkable incidents of his life,
    as I had them from the Traders and the Indian agents, and afterwards
    corroborated by his own words, translated to me as he spoke, whilst I
    was writing them down.</p>

  <p>The dress of Mah-to-toh-pa then, the greater part of which I have
    represented in his full-length portrait, and which I shall now
    describe, was purchased of him after I had painted his picture; and
    every article of it can be seen in my Indian Gallery by the side of
    the portrait, provided I succeed in getting them home to the civilized
    world without injury.</p>

  <p>Mah-to-toh-pa had agreed to stand before me for his portrait at an
    early hour of the next morning, and on that day I sat with my palette
    of colours prepared, and waited till twelve o’clock, before he could
    leave his toilette with feelings of satisfaction as to the propriety of
    his looks and the arrangement of his equipments; and at that time it
    was announced, that “Mah-to-toh-pa was coming in full dress!” I looked
    out of the door of the wigwam, and saw him approaching with a firm and
    elastic step, accompanied by a great crowd of women and children, who
    were gazing on him with admiration, and escorting him to my room. No
    tragedian ever trod the stage, nor gladiator ever entered the Roman
    Forum, with more grace and manly dignity than did Mah-to-toh-pa enter
    the wigwam, where I was in readiness to receive him. He took his
    attitude before me (<a href="#i_064"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 64</a>), and with the sternness of a
    Brutus and the stillness of a statue, he stood until the darkness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
    of night broke upon the solitary stillness. His dress, which was a
    very splendid one, was complete in all its parts, and consisted of a
    shirt or tunic, leggings, moccasins, head-dress, necklace, shield,
    bow and quiver, lance, tobacco-sack, and pipe; robe, belt, and knife;
    medicine-bag, tomahawk, and war-club, or <i lang="mhq">po-ko-mo-kon</i>.</p>

  <p>The shirt, of which I have spoken, was made of two skins of the
    mountain-sheep, beautifully dressed, and sewed together by seams which
    rested upon the arms; one skin hanging in front, upon the breast, and
    the other falling down upon the back; the head being passed between
    them, and they falling over and resting on the shoulders. Across each
    shoulder, and somewhat in the form of an epaulette, was a beautiful
    band; and down each arm from the neck to the hand was a similar one,
    of two inches in width (and crossing the other at right angles on the
    shoulder) beautifully embroidered with porcupine quills worked on the
    dress, and covering the seams. To the lower edge of these bands the
    whole way, at intervals of half an inch, were attached long locks of
    black hair, which he had taken with his own hand from the heads of
    his enemies whom he had slain in battle, and which he thus wore as a
    trophy, and also as an ornament to his dress. The front and back of
    the shirt were curiously garnished in several parts with porcupine
    quills and paintings of the battles he had fought, and also with
    representations of the victims that had fallen by his hand. The bottom
    of the dress was bound or hemmed with ermine skins, and tassels of
    ermines’ tails were suspended from the arms and the shoulders.</p>

  <p>The <em>Leggings</em>, which were made of deer skins, beautifully
    dressed, and fitting tight to the leg, extended from the feet to the
    hips, and were fastened to a belt which was passed around the waist.
    These, like the shirt, had a similar band, worked with porcupine quills
    of richest dyes, passing down the seam on the outer part of the leg,
    and fringed also the whole length of the leg, with the scalp-locks
    taken from his enemies’ heads.</p>

  <p>The <em>Moccasins</em> were of buckskin, and covered in almost every part
    with the beautiful embroidery of porcupines’ quills.</p>

  <p>The <em>Head-dress</em>, which was superb and truly magnificent,
    consisted of a crest of war-eagles’ quills, gracefully falling back
    from the forehead over the back part of the head, and extending quite
    down to his feet; set the whole way in a profusion of ermine, and
    surmounted on the top of the head, with the horns of the buffalo,
    shaved thin and highly polished.</p>

  <p>The <em>Necklace</em> was made of fifty huge claws or nails of the
    grizzly bear, ingeniously arranged on the skin of an otter, and worn,
    like the scalp-locks, as a trophy—as an evidence unquestionable, that
    he had contended with and overcome that desperate enemy in open combat.</p>

  <p>His <em>Shield</em> was made of the hide of the buffalo’s neck, and
    hardened with the glue that was taken from its hoofs; its boss was the
    skin of a pole-cat, and its edges were fringed with rows of eagles’
    quills and hoofs of the antelope.</p>

  <p>His <em>Bow</em> was of bone, and as white and beautiful as ivory; over
    its back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span> was laid, and firmly attached to it, a coating of deers’
    sinews, which gave it its elasticity, and of course death to all that
    stood inimically before it. Its string was three stranded and twisted
    of sinews, which many a time had twanged and sent the whizzing death to
    animal and to human victims.</p>

  <figure class="mt2 illowp75" id="i_064">
    <div class="plate "><i>38</i></div>
    <img src="images/i_064.jpg" alt="" />
     <figcaption>64</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The <em>Quiver</em> was made of a panther’s skin and hung upon his back,
    charged with its deadly arrows; some were poisoned and some were not;
    they were feathered with hawks’ and eagles’ quills; some were clean and
    innocent, and pure, and others were stained all over, with animal and
    human blood that was dried upon them. Their blades or points were of
    flints, and some of steel; and altogether were a deadly magazine.</p>

  <p>The <em>Lance</em> or spear was held in his left hand; its blade was
    two-edged and of polished steel, and the blood of several human victims
    was seen dried upon it, one over the other; its shaft was of the
    toughest ash, and ornamented at intervals with tufts of war-eagles’
    quills.</p>

  <p>His <em>Tobacco-sack</em> was made of the skin of an otter, and
    tastefully garnished with quills of the porcupine; in it was carried
    his <i lang="mhq">k’nick k’neck</i>, (the bark of the red willow, which is smoked
    as a substitute for tobacco), it contained also his flint and steel,
    and spunk for lighting——</p>

  <p>His <em>Pipe</em>, which was ingeniously carved out of the red steatite
    (or pipe-stone), the stem of which was three feet long and two inches
    wide, made from the stalk of the young ash; about half its length was
    wound with delicate braids of the porcupine’s quills, so ingeniously
    wrought as to represent figures of men and animals upon it. It was
    also ornamented with the skins and beaks of wood-peckers’ heads, and
    the hair of the white buffalo’s tail. The lower half of the stem was
    painted red, and on its edges it bore the notches he had recorded for
    the snows (or years) of his life.</p>

  <p>His <em>Robe</em> was made of the skin of a young buffalo bull, with the
    fur on one side, and the other finely and delicately dressed; with all
    the battles of his life emblazoned on it by his own hand.</p>

  <p>His <em>Belt</em>, which was of a substantial piece of buckskin, was
    firmly girded around his waist; and in it were worn his tomahawk and
    scalping-knife.</p>

  <p>His <em>Medicine-bag</em> was the skin of a beaver, curiously ornamented
    with hawks’ bills and ermine. It was held in his right hand, and his
    <i lang="mhq">po-ko-mo-kon</i> (or war-club) which was made of a round stone, tied
    up in a piece of rawhide, and attached to the end of a stick, somewhat
    in the form of a sling, was laid with others of his weapons at his feet.</p>

  <p>Such was the dress of Mah-to-toh-pa when he entered my wigwam to stand
    for his picture; but such I have not entirely represented it in his
    portrait; having rejected such trappings and ornaments as interfered
    with the grace and simplicity of the figure. He was beautifully and
    extravagantly dressed; and in this he was not alone, for hundreds of
    others are equally elegant. In plumes, and arms, and ornaments, he is
    not singular; but in laurels and wreaths he stands unparalleled. His
    breast has been bared and scarred in defence of his country, and his
    brows crowned with honours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span> that elevate him conspicuous above all of
    his nation. There is no man amongst the Mandans so generally loved,
    nor any one who wears a robe so justly famed and honourable as that of
    Mah-to-toh-pa.</p>

  <p>I said his robe was of the skin of a young buffalo bull, and that the
    battles of his life were emblazoned on it; and on a former occasion,
    that he presented me a beautiful robe, containing all the battles
    of his life, which he had spent two weeks’ time in copying from his
    original one, which he wore on his shoulders.</p>

  <p>This robe, with his tracings on it, is the chart of his military life;
    and when explained, will tell more of Mah-to-toh-pa.</p>

  <p>Some days after this robe was presented, he called upon me with Mr.
    Kipp, the trader and interpreter for the Mandans, and gave me of each
    battle there pourtrayed the following history, which was interpreted
    by Mr. Kipp, from his own lips, and written down by me, as we three
    sat upon the robe. Mr. Kipp, who is a gentleman of respectability and
    truth; and who has lived with these people ten years, assured me, that
    nearly every one of these narrations were of events that had happened
    whilst he had lived with them, and had been familiarly known to him;
    and that every word that he asserted was true.</p>

  <p>And again, reader, in this country where, of all countries I ever
    was in, men are the most jealous of rank and of standing; and in a
    community so small also, that every man’s deeds of honour and chivalry
    are familiarly known to all; it would not be reputable, or even safe
    to life, for a warrior to wear upon his back the representations of
    battles he never had fought; professing to have done what every child
    in the village would know he never had done.</p>

  <p>So then I take the records of battles on the robe of Mah-to-toh-pa
    to be matter of historical fact; and I proceed to give them as I
    wrote them down from his own lips. Twelve battle-scenes are there
    represented, where he has contended with his enemy, and in which he has
    taken fourteen of their scalps. The groups are drawn according to his
    own rude ideas of the arts; and I proceed to describe them in turn, as
    they were explained to me.</p>

  <h3>ROBE OF MAH-TO-TOH-PA (<a href="#i_065"><span class="smcap">Plate</span> 65</a>).</h3>

  <p>1. Mah-to-toh-pa kills a Sioux chief—the three heads represent the
    three Riccarees, whom the Sioux chief had previously killed. The Sioux
    chief is seen with war-paint black on his face. Mah-to-toh-pa is seen
    with the scalp of the Sioux in one hand, and his knife in the other,
    with his bow and quiver lying behind him.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

  <p>2. A Shienne chief, who sent word to Mah-to-toh-pa that he wished to
    fight him—was killed by Mah-to-toh-pa with a lance, in presence of a
    large <span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>party of Mandans and Shiennes. Mah-to-toh-pa is here known
    by his lance with eagles’ quills on it.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>3. A Shienne killed by Mah-to-toh-pa after Mah-to-toh-pa had been left
    by his party, badly wounded and bleeding; the twenty-five or thirty
    foot-tracks around, represent the number of Shiennes, who were present
    when the battle took place; and the bullets from their guns represented
    as flying all around the head of Mah-to-toh-pa.</p>

  <p>4. Shienne chief with war-eagle head-dress, and a beautiful shield,
    ornamented with eagles’ quills, killed by Mah-to-toh-pa. In this
    battle the wife of the Shienne rushed forward in a desperate manner to
    his assistance; but arriving too late, fell a victim. In this battle
    Mah-to-toh-pa obtained two scalps.</p>

  <p>5. Mah-to-toh-pa, with a party of Riccarees, fired at by a party of
    Sioux; the Riccarees fled—Mah-to-toh-pa dismounted and drove his horse
    back, facing the enemy alone and killing one of them. Mah-to-toh-pa is
    here represented with a beautiful head-dress of war-eagles’ quills,
    and one on his horse’s head of equal beauty; his shield is on his arm,
    and the party of Sioux is represented in front of him by the number of
    horse tracks.</p>

  <p>6. The brother of Mah-to-toh-pa killed by a Riccaree, who shot him with
    an arrow, and then running a lance through his body, left it there.
    Mah-to-toh-pa was the first to find his brother’s body with the lance
    in it: he drew the lance from the body, kept it four years with the
    blood dried on its blade, and then, according to his oath, killed the
    same Riccaree with the same lance; the dead body of his brother is here
    seen with the arrow and lance remaining in it, and the tracks of the
    Riccaree’s horses in front.</p>

  <p>The following was, perhaps, one of the most extraordinary exploits
    of this remarkable man’s life, and is well attested by Mr. Kipp, and
    several white men, who were living in the Mandan village at the time of
    its occurrence. In a skirmish, near the Mandan village, when they were
    set upon by their enemies, the Riccarees, the brother of Mah-to-toh-pa
    was missing for several days, when Mah-to-toh-pa found the body
    shockingly mangled, and a handsome spear left piercing the body through
    the heart. The spear was by him brought into the Mandan village, where
    it was recognized by many as a famous weapon belonging to a noted brave
    of the Riccarees, by the name of Won-ga-tap. This spear was brandished
    through the Mandan village by Mah-to-toh-pa (with the blood of his
    brother dried on its blade), crying most piteously, and swearing that
    he would some day revenge the death of his brother with the same weapon.</p>

  <p>It is almost an incredible fact, that he kept this spear with great
    care in his wigwam for the space of four years, in the fruitless
    expectation of an opportunity to use it upon the breast of its owner;
    when his indignant soul, impatient of further delay, burst forth in the
    most uncontroullable frenzy and fury; he again brandished it through
    the village, and said, that the blood of his brother’s heart which was
    seen on its blade was yet fresh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
    and called loudly for revenge. “Let
    every Mandan (said he) be silent, and let no one sound the name of
    Mah-to-toh-pa—let no one ask for him, nor where he has gone, until you
    hear him sound the war-cry in front of the village, when he will enter
    it and shew you the blood of Won-ga-tap. The blade of this lance shall
    drink the heart’s blood of Won-ga-tap, or Mah-to-toh-pa mingles his
    shadow with that of his brother.”</p>

  <p>With this he sallied forth from the village, and over the plains,
    with the lance in his hand; his direction was towards the Riccaree
    village, and all eyes were upon him, though none dared to speak till he
    disappeared over the distant grassy bluffs. He travelled the distance
    of two hundred miles entirely alone, with a little parched corn in
    his pouch, making his marches by night, and laying secreted by days,
    until he reached the Riccaree village; where (being acquainted with
    its shapes and its habits, and knowing the position of the wigwam of
    his doomed enemy) he loitered about in disguise, mingling himself in
    the obscure throng; and at last, silently and alone, observed through
    the rents of the wigwam, the last motions and movements of his victim,
    as he retired to bed with his wife: he saw him light his last pipe and
    smoke it “to its end”—he saw the last whiff, and saw the last curl of
    blue smoke that faintly steeped from its bowl—he saw the village awhile
    in darkness and silence, and the embers that were covered in the middle
    of the wigwam gone nearly out, and the last flickering light which had
    been gently playing over them; when he walked softly, but not slyly,
    into the wigwam and seated himself by the fire, over which was hanging
    a large pot, with a quantity of cooked meat remaining in it; and by
    the side of the fire, the pipe and tobacco-pouch which had just been
    used; and knowing that the twilight of the wigwam was not sufficient to
    disclose the features of his face to his enemy, he very deliberately
    turned to the pot and completely satiated the desperate appetite, which
    he had got in a journey of six or seven days, with little or nothing
    to eat; and then, as deliberately, charged and lighted the pipe, and
    sent (no doubt, in every whiff that he drew through its stem) a prayer
    to the Great Spirit for a moment longer for the consummation of his
    design. Whilst eating and smoking, the wife of his victim, while laying
    in bed, several times enquired of her husband, what man it was who was
    eating in their lodge? to which, he as many times replied, “It’s no
    matter; let him eat, for he is probably hungry.”</p>

  <p>Mah-to-toh-pa knew full well that his appearance would cause no other
    reply than this, from the dignitary of the nation; for, from an
    invariable custom amongst these Northern Indians, any one who is hungry
    is allowed to walk into any man’s lodge and eat. Whilst smoking his
    last gentle and tremulous whiffs on the pipe, Mah-to-toh-pa (leaning
    back, and turning gradually on his side, to get a better view of the
    position of his enemy, and to see a little more distinctly the shapes
    of things) stirred the embers with his toes (readers, I had every
    word of this from his own lips, and every attitude and gesture acted
    out with his own limbs), until he saw his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span> way was clear; at which
    moment, with his lance in his hands, he rose and drove it through the
    body of his enemy, and snatching the scalp from his head, he darted
    from the lodge—and quick as lightning, with the lance in one hand,
    and the scalp in the other, made his way to the prairie! The village
    was in an uproar, but he was off, and no one knew the enemy who had
    struck the blow. Mah-to-toh-pa ran all night, and lay close during the
    days; thanking the Great Spirit for strengthening his heart and his
    arm to this noble revenge; and prayed fervently for a continuance of
    his aid and protection till he should get back to his own village. His
    prayers were heard; and on the sixth morning, at sunrise, Mah-to-toh-pa
    descended the bluffs, and entered the village amidst deafening shouts
    of applause, while he brandished and shewed to his people the blade of
    his lance, with the blood of his victim dried upon it, over that of his
    brother; and the scalp of Won-ga-tap suspended from its handle.</p>

  <figure class="mt2 illowp75">
  <div class="plate"><i>42</i></div>
    <img src="images/i_065c.jpg" alt="" />
  </figure>

  <p>Such was the feat represented by Mah-to-toh-pa on his robe—and the
    lance, of which I have just spoken, is seen in the hand of his
    portrait, which will stand in my Gallery, and of which I have thus
    formerly spoken:—“The lance or spear of Mah-to-toh-pa, when he stood
    for his portrait, was held in his left hand; its blade was two-edged,
    and of polished steel, and the blood of several human victims was
    seen dried upon its surface, one over the other; its shaft was of the
    toughest ash, and ornamented at intervals with tufts of war-eagle’s
    quills.”</p>

  <p>In the portrait, of which I am speaking, there will be seen an eagle’s
    quill balanced on the hilt of the lance, severed from its original
    position, and loose from the weapon. When I painted his portrait,
    he brought that quill to my wigwam in his left hand, and carefully
    balancing it on the lance, as seen in the painting; he desired me to be
    very exact with it, to have it appear as separate from, and unconnected
    with, the lance; and to represent a spot of blood which was visible
    upon it. I indulged him in his request, and then got from him the
    following explanation:—“That quill (said he) is great <em>medicine</em>!
    it belongs to the Great Spirit, and not to me—when I was running out of
    the lodge of Won-ga-tap, I looked back and saw that quill hanging to
    the wound in his side; I ran back, and pulling it out, brought it home
    in my left hand, and I have kept it for the Great Spirit to this day!”</p>

  <p>“Why do you not then tie it on to the lance again, where it came off?”</p>

  <p>“Hush-sh (said he), if the Great Spirit had wished it to be tied on in
    that place, it never would have come off; he has been kind to me, and I
    will not offend him.”</p>

  <p>7. A Riccaree killed by Mah-to-toh-pa in revenge of the death of a
    white man killed by a Riccaree in the Fur Traders’ Fort, a short time
    previous.</p>

  <p>8. Mah-to-toh-pa, or four bears, kills a Shienne chief, who challenged
    him to single combat, in presence of the two war-parties; they fought
    on horseback with guns, until Mah-to-toh-pa’s powder-horn was shot
    away; they then fought with bows and arrows, until their quivers were
    emptied, when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> dismounted and fought single-handed. The Shienne
    drew his knife, and Mah-to-toh-pa had left his; they struggled for the
    knife, which Mah-to-toh-pa wrested from the Shienne, and killed him
    with it; in the struggle, the blade of the knife was several times
    drawn through the hand of Mah-to-toh-pa, and the blood is seen running
    from the wound.</p>

  <p>This extraordinary occurrence also, was one which admits of, and
    deserves a more elaborate description, which I will here give as it
    was translated from his own lips, while he sat upon the robe, pointing
    to his painting of it; and at the same time brandishing the identical
    knife which he drew from his belt, as he was shewing how the fatal blow
    was given; and exhibiting the wounds inflicted in his hand, as the
    blade of the knife was several times drawn through it before he wrested
    it from his antagonist.</p>

  <p>A party of about 150 Shienne warriors had made an assault upon the
    Mandan village at an early hour in the morning, and driven off a
    considerable number of horses, and taken one scalp. Mah-to-toh-pa,
    who was then a young man, but famed as one of the most valiant of the
    Mandans, took the lead of a party of fifty warriors, all he could at
    that time muster, and went in pursuit of the enemy; about noon of the
    second day, they came in sight of the Shiennes; and the Mandans seeing
    their enemy much more numerous than they had expected, were generally
    disposed to turn about and return without attacking them. They started
    to go back, when Mah-to-toh-pa galloped out in front upon the prairie,
    and plunged his lance into the ground; the blade was driven into the
    earth to its hilt—he made another circuit around, and in that circuit
    tore from his breast his reddened sash, which he hung upon its handle
    as a flag, calling out to the Mandans, “What! have we come to this?
    we have dogged our enemy two days, and now when we have found them,
    are we to turn about and go back like cowards? Mah-to-toh-pa’s lance,
    which is red with the blood of brave men, has led you to the sight of
    your enemy, and you have followed it; it now stands firm in the ground,
    where the earth will drink the blood of Mah-to-toh-pa! you may all go
    back, and Mah-to-toh-pa will fight them alone!”</p>

  <p>During this manœuvre, the Shiennes, who had discovered the Mandans
    behind them, had turned about and were gradually approaching, in order
    to give them battle; the chief of the Shienne war-party seeing and
    understanding the difficulty, and admiring the gallant conduct of
    Mah-to-toh-pa, galloped his horse forward within hailing distance, in
    front of the Mandans, and called out to know “who he was who had stuck
    down his lance and defied the whole enemy alone?”</p>

  <p>“I am Mah-to-toh-pa, second in command of the brave and valiant
    Mandans.”</p>

  <p>“I have heard often of Mah-to-toh-pa, he is a great warrior—dares
    Mah-to-toh-pa to come forward and fight this battle with me alone, and
    our warriors will look on?”</p>

  <p>“Is he a chief who speaks to Mah-to-toh-pa?”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

  <p>“My scalps you see hanging to my horse’s bits, and here is my lance
    with the ermine skins and the war-eagle’s tail!”</p>

  <p>“You have said enough.”</p>

  <p>The Shienne chief made a circuit or two at full gallop on a beautiful
    white horse, when he struck his lance into the ground, and left it
    standing by the side of the lance of Mah-to-toh-pa, both of which were
    waving together their little red flags, tokens of blood and defiance.</p>

  <p>The two parties then drew nearer, on a beautiful prairie, and the
    two full-plumed chiefs, at full speed, drove furiously upon each
    other! both firing their guns at the same moment. They passed each
    other a little distance and wheeled, when Mah-to-toh-pa drew off his
    powder-horn, and by holding it up, shewed his adversary that the bullet
    had shattered it to pieces and destroyed his ammunition; he then threw
    it from him, and his gun also—drew his bow from his quiver, and an
    arrow, and his shield upon his left arm! The Shienne instantly did
    the same; <em>his</em> horn was thrown off, and his gun was thrown into
    the air—his shield was balanced on his arm—his bow drawn, and quick
    as lightning, they were both on the wing for a deadly combat! Like
    two soaring eagles in the open air, they made their circuits around,
    and the twangs of their sinewy bows were heard, and the war-whoop,
    as they dashed by each other, parrying off the whizzing arrows with
    their shields! Some lodged in their legs and others in their arms; but
    both protected their <em>bodies</em> with their bucklers of bull’s hide.
    Deadly and many were the shafts that fled from their murderous bows. At
    length the horse of Mah-to-toh-pa fell to the ground with an arrow in
    his heart; his rider sprang upon his feet prepared to renew the combat;
    but the Shienne, seeing his adversary dismounted, sprang from his
    horse, and driving him back, presented the face of his shield towards
    his enemy, inviting him to come on!—a few shots more were exchanged
    thus, when the Shienne, having discharged all his arrows, held up his
    empty quiver and dashing it furiously to the ground, with his bow and
    his shield; drew and brandished his naked knife!</p>

  <p>“Yes!” said Mah-to-toh-pa, as he threw <em>his</em> shield and quiver to
    the earth, and was rushing up—<em>he</em> grasped for his knife, but his
    belt had it not; he had left it at home! his bow was in his hand, with
    which he parried his antagonist’s blow and felled him to the ground! A
    desperate struggle now ensued for the knife—the blade of it was several
    times drawn through the right hand of Mah-to-toh-pa, inflicting the
    most frightful wounds, while he was severely wounded in several parts
    of the body. He at length succeeded however, in wresting it from his
    adversary’s hand, and plunged it to his heart.</p>

  <p>By this time the two parties had drawn up in close view of each other,
    and at the close of the battle, Mah-to-toh-pa held up, and claimed in
    deadly silence, the knife and scalp of the noble Shienne chief.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

  <p>9. Several hundred Minatarees and Mandans attacked by a party of
    Assinneboins—all fled but Mah-to-toh-pa, who stood his ground,
    fired, and killed one of the enemy, putting the rest of them to
    flight, and driving off sixty horses! He is here seen with his lance
    and shield—foot-tracks of his enemy in front, and his own party’s
    horse-tracks behind him, and a shower of bullets flying around
    his head; here he got the name of “<em>the four bears</em>,” as the
    Assinneboins said he rushed on like four bears.</p>

  <p>10. Mah-to-toh-pa gets from his horse and kills two Ojibbeway women,
    and takes their scalps; done by the side of an Ojibbeway village, where
    they went to the river for water. He is here seen with his lance in
    one hand and his knife in the other—an eagle’s plume head-dress on his
    horse, and his shield left on his horse’s back. I incurred his ill-will
    for awhile by asking him, whether it was manly to boast of taking
    the scalps of women? and his pride prevented him from giving me any
    explanation or apology. The interpreter, however, explained to me that
    he had secreted himself in the most daring manner, in full sight of the
    Ojibbeway village, seeking to revenge a murder, where he remained six
    days without sustenance, and then killed the two women in full view of
    the tribe, and made his escape, which entitled him to the credit of a
    victory, though his victims were women.</p>

  <p>11. A large party of Assinneboins entrenched near the Mandan
    village attacked by the Mandans and Minatarees, who were driven
    back—Mah-to-toh-pa rushes into the entrenchment alone—an Indian fires
    at him and burns his face with the muzzle of his gun, which burst—the
    Indian retreats, leaving his exploded gun, and Mah-to-toh-pa shoots
    him through the shoulders as he runs, and kills him with his tomahawk;
    the gun of the Assinneboin is seen falling to the ground, and in front
    of him the heads of the Assinneboins in the entrenchment; the horse of
    Mah-to-toh-pa is seen behind him.</p>

  <p>12. Mah-to-toh-pa between his enemy the Sioux, and his own people, with
    an arrow shot through him, after standing the fire of the Sioux for a
    long time alone. In this battle he took no scalps, yet his valour was
    so extraordinary that the chiefs and braves awarded him the honour of a
    victory.</p>

  <p>This feat is seen in the centre of the robe—head-dress of war-eagles’
    quills on his own and his horse’s head—the tracks of his enemies’
    horses are seen in front of him, and bullets flying both ways all
    around him. With his whip in his hand, he is seen urging his horse
    forward, and an arrow is seen flying, and bloody, as it has passed
    through his body. For this wound, and the several others mentioned
    above, he bears the honourable scars on his body, which he generally
    keeps covered with red paint.</p>

  <p>Such are the battles traced upon the robe of Mah-to-toh-pa or four
    bears, interpreted by J. Kipp from the words of the hero while sitting
    upon the robe, explaining each battle as represented.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MANDAN VILLAGE, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Oh!</span> “<i lang="fr">horribile visu—et mirabile dictu!</i>” Thank God, it is over,
    that I have seen it, and am able to tell it to the world.</p>

  <p>The <em>annual religious ceremony</em>, of four days, of which I have so
    often spoken, and which I have so long been wishing to see, has at last
    been enacted in this village; and I have, fortunately, been able to
    see and to understand it in most of its bearings, which was more than
    I had reason to expect; for no white man, in all probability, has ever
    been before admitted to the <em>medicine-lodge</em> during these most
    remarkable and appalling scenes.</p>

  <p>Well and truly has it been said, that the Mandans are a strange and
    peculiar people; and most correctly had I been informed, that this
    was an important and interesting scene, by those who had, on former
    occasions, witnessed such parts of it as are transacted out of doors,
    and in front of the <em>medicine-lodge</em>.</p>

  <p>Since the date of my last Letter, I was lucky enough to have painted
    the <em>medicine-man</em>, who was high-priest on this grand occasion, or
    conductor of the ceremonies, who had me regularly installed doctor or
    “<em>medicine</em>;” and who, on the morning when these grand refinements
    in mysteries commenced, took me by the arm, and led me into the
    <em>medicine-lodge</em>, where the Fur Trader, Mr. Kipp, and his two
    clerks accompanied me in close attendance for four days; all of us
    going to our own quarters at sun-down, and returning again at sun-rise
    the next morning.</p>

  <p>I took my sketch-book with me, and have made many and faithful drawings
    of what we saw, and full notes of everything as translated to me by
    the interpreter; and since the close of that horrid and frightful
    scene, which was a week ago or more, I have been closely ensconced
    in an earth-covered wigwam, with a fine sky-light over my head, with
    my palette and brushes, endeavouring faithfully to put the whole
    of what we saw upon canvass, which my companions all agree to be
    critically correct, and of the fidelity of which they have attached
    their certificates to the backs of the paintings. I have made four
    paintings of these strange scenes, containing several hundred figures,
    representing the transactions of each day; and if I live to get them
    home, they will be found to be exceedingly curious and interesting.</p>

  <p>I shudder at the relation, or even at the thought of these barbarous
    and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span> cruel scenes, and am almost ready to shrink from the task of
    reciting them after I have so long promised some account of them. I
    entered the <em>medicine-house</em> of these scenes, as I would have
    entered a church, and expected to see something extraordinary and
    strange, but yet in the form of worship or devotion; but alas! little
    did I expect to see the interior of their holy temple turned into a
    <em>slaughter-house</em>, and its floor strewed with the blood of its
    fanatic devotees. Little did I think that I was entering a house of
    God, where His blinded worshippers were to pollute its sacred interior
    with their blood, and propitiatory suffering and tortures—surpassing,
    if possible, the cruelty of the rack or the inquisition; but such the
    scene has been, and as such I will endeavour to describe it.</p>

  <p>The “<em>Mandan religious ceremony</em>” then, as I believe it is
    very justly denominated, is an annual transaction, held in their
    <em>medicine-lodge</em> once a year, as a great religious anniversary,
    and for several distinct objects, as I shall in a few minutes describe;
    during and after which, they look with implicit reliance for the
    justification and approval of the Great Spirit.</p>

  <p>All of the Indian tribes, as I have before observed, are religious—are
    worshipful—and many of them go to almost incredible lengths (as will
    be seen in the present instance, and many others I may recite) in
    worshipping the Great Spirit; denying and humbling themselves before
    Him for the same purpose, and in the same hope as we do, perhaps in a
    more rational and acceptable way.</p>

  <p>The tribes, so far as I have visited them, all distinctly believe in
    the existence of a Great (or Good) Spirit, an Evil (or Bad) Spirit,
    and also in a future existence and future accountability, according
    to their virtues and vices in this world. So far the North American
    Indians would seem to be one family, and such an unbroken theory
    amongst them; yet with regard to the manner and form, and time and
    place of that accountability—to the constructions of virtues and vices,
    and the modes of appeasing and propitiating the Good and Evil Spirits,
    they are found with all the changes and variety which fortuitous
    circumstances, and fictions, and fables have wrought upon them.</p>

  <p>If from their superstitions and their ignorance, there are oftentimes
    obscurities and mysteries thrown over and around their system, yet
    these affect not the theory itself, which is everywhere essentially
    the same—and which, if it be not correct, has this much to command
    the admiration of the enlightened world, that they worship with great
    sincerity, and all according to one creed.</p>

  <p>The Mandans believe in the existence of a Great (or Good) Spirit, and
    also of an Evil Spirit, who they say existed long before the Good
    Spirit, and is far superior in power. They all believe also in a
    future state of existence, and a future administration of rewards and
    punishments, and (so do all other tribes that I have yet visited) they
    believe those punishments are not eternal, but commensurate with their
    sins.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

  <p>These people living in a climate where they suffer from cold in the
    severity of their winters, have very naturally reversed our ideas of
    Heaven and Hell. The latter they describe to be a country very far
    to the north, of barren and hideous aspect, and covered with eternal
    snows and ice. The torments of this freezing place they describe as
    most excruciating; whilst Heaven they suppose to be in a warmer and
    delightful latitude, where nothing is felt but the keenest enjoyment,
    and where the country abounds in buffaloes and other luxuries of life.
    The Great or Good Spirit they believe dwells in the former place for
    the purpose of there meeting those who have offended him; increasing
    the agony of their sufferings, by being himself present, administering
    the penalties. The Bad or Evil Spirit they at the same time suppose to
    reside in Paradise, still tempting the happy; and those who have gone
    to the regions of punishment they believe to be tortured for a time
    proportioned to the amount of their transgressions, and that they are
    then to be transferred to the land of the happy, where they are again
    liable to the temptations of the Evil Spirit, and answerable again at a
    future period for their new offences.</p>

  <p>Such is the religious creed of the Mandans, and for the purpose of
    appeasing the Good and Evil Spirits, and to secure their entrance into
    those “fields Elysian,” or beautiful hunting grounds, do the young
    men subject themselves to the horrid and sickening cruelties to be
    described in the following pages.</p>

  <p>There are other three distinct objects (yet to be named) for which
    these religious ceremonies are held, which are as follow:—</p>

  <p><em>First</em>, they are held annually as a celebration of
    the event of the subsiding of the Flood, which they call
    <i lang="mhq">Mee-nee-ro-ka-ha-sha</i>, (sinking down or settling of the waters.)</p>

  <p><em>Secondly</em>, for the purpose of dancing what they call,
    <i lang="mhq">Bel-lohck-na-pic</i> (the bull-dance); to the strict observance of
    which they attribute the coming of buffaloes to supply them with food
    during the season; and</p>

  <p><em>Thirdly</em> and lastly, for the purpose of conducting all the young
    men of the tribe, as they annually arrive to the age of manhood,
    through an ordeal of privation and torture, which, while it is supposed
    to harden their muscles and prepare them for extreme endurance,
    enables the chiefs who are spectators to the scene, to decide upon
    their comparative bodily strength and ability to endure the extreme
    privations and sufferings that often fall to the lots of Indian
    warriors; and that they may decide who is the most hardy and best able
    to lead a war-party in case of extreme exigency.</p>

  <p>This part of the ceremony, as I have just witnessed it, is truly
    shocking to behold, and will almost stagger the belief of the world
    when they read of it. The scene is too terrible and too revolting to
    be seen or to be told, were it not an essential part of a whole, which
    will be new to the civilized world, and therefore worth their knowing.</p>

  <p>The bull-dance, and many other parts of these ceremonies are
    exceedingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span> grotesque and amusing, and that part of them which has a
    relation to the Deluge is harmless and full of interest.</p>

  <p>In the centre of the Mandan village is an open, circular area of 150
    feet diameter, kept always clear, as a public ground, for the display
    of all their public feasts, parades, &amp;c. and around it are their
    wigwams placed as near to each other as they can well stand, their
    doors facing the centre of this public area.</p>

  <p>In the middle of this ground, which is trodden like a hard pavement,
    is a curb (somewhat like a large hogshead standing on its end) made
    of planks (and bound with hoops), some eight or nine feet high, which
    they religiously preserve and protect from year to year, free from
    mark or scratch, and which they call the “big canoe”—it is undoubtedly
    a symbolic representation of a part of their traditional history of
    the Flood; which it is very evident, from this and numerous other
    features of this grand ceremony, they have in some way or other
    received, and are here endeavouring to perpetuate by vividly impressing
    it on the minds of the whole nation. This object of superstition,
    from its position, as the very centre of the village is the rallying
    point of the whole nation. To it their devotions are paid on various
    occasions of feasts and religious exercises during the year; and in
    this extraordinary scene it was often the nucleus of their mysteries
    and cruelties, as I shall shortly describe them, and becomes an object
    worth bearing in mind, and worthy of being understood.</p>

  <p>This exciting and appalling scene, then, which is familiarly (and no
    doubt correctly) called the “Mandan religious ceremony,” commences, not
    on a particular day of the year, (for these people keep no record of
    days or weeks), but at a particular season, which is designated by the
    full expansion of the willow leaves under the bank of the river; for
    according to their tradition, “the twig that the bird brought home was
    a willow bough, and had full-grown leaves on it,” and the bird to which
    they allude, is the mourning or turtle-dove, which they took great
    pains to point out to me, as it is often to be seen feeding on the
    sides of their earth-covered lodges, and which, being, as they call it,
    a <em>medicine-bird</em>, is not to be destroyed or harmed by any one,
    and even their dogs are instructed not to do it injury.</p>

  <p>On the morning on which this strange transaction commenced, I was
    sitting at breakfast in the house of the Trader, Mr. Kipp, when at
    sun-rise, we were suddenly startled by the shrieking and screaming
    of the women, and barking and howling of dogs, as if an enemy were
    actually storming their village.</p>

  <p>“Now we have it!” (exclaimed <em>mine host</em>, as he sprang from the
    table,) the grand ceremony has commenced!—“drop your knife and fork,
    Monsr. and get your sketch-book as soon as possible, that you may lose
    nothing, for the very moment of <em>commencing</em> is as curious as
    anything else of this strange affair.” I seized my sketch-book, and all
    hands of us were in an instant in front of the medicine-lodge, ready
    to see and to hear all that was to take place. Groups of women and
    children were gathered on the tops of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span> their earth-covered wigwams, and
    all were screaming, and dogs were howling, and all eyes directed to the
    prairies in the West, where was beheld at a mile distant, a solitary
    individual descending a prairie bluff, and making his way in a direct
    line towards the village!</p>

  <p>The whole community joined in the general expression of great alarm,
    as if they were in danger of instant destruction; bows were strung and
    thrumed to test their elasticity—their horses were caught upon the
    prairie and run into the village—warriors were blackening their faces,
    and dogs were muzzled, and every preparation made, as if for instant
    combat.</p>

  <p>During this deafening din and confusion within the piquets of the
    village of the Mandans, the figure discovered on the prairie continued
    to approach with a dignified step and in a right line towards the
    village; all eyes were upon him, and he at length made his appearance
    (without opposition) within the piquets, and proceeded towards the
    centre of the village, where all the chiefs and braves stood ready to
    receive him, which they did in a cordial manner, by shaking hands with
    him, recognizing him as an old acquaintance, and pronouncing his name
    <i lang="mhq">Nu-mohk-muck-a-nah</i> (the first or only man). The body of this
    strange personage, which was chiefly naked, was painted with white
    clay, so as to resemble at a little distance, a white man; he wore a
    robe of four white wolf skins falling back over his shoulders; on his
    head he had a splendid head-dress made of two ravens’ skins, and in
    his left hand he cautiously carried a large pipe, which he seemed to
    watch and guard as something of great importance. After passing the
    chiefs and braves as described, he approached the <em>medicine</em> or
    mystery lodge, which he had the means of opening, and which had been
    religiously closed during the year except for the performance of these
    religious rites.</p>

  <p>Having opened and entered it, he called in four men whom he appointed
    to clean it out, and put it in readiness for the ceremonies, by
    sweeping it and strewing a profusion of green willow-boughs over its
    floor, and with them decorating its sides. Wild sage also, and many
    other aromatic herbs they gathered from the prairies, and scattered
    over its floor; and over these were arranged a curious group of buffalo
    and human skulls, and other articles, which were to be used during this
    strange and unaccountable transaction.</p>

  <p>During the whole of this day, and while these preparations were making
    in the <em>medicine-lodge</em>, Nu-mohk-muck-a-nah (the first or only
    man) travelled through the village, stopping in front of every man’s
    lodge, and crying until the owner of the lodge came out, and asked
    who he was, and what was the matter? to which he replied by relating
    the sad catastrophe which had happened on the earth’s surface by the
    overflowing of the waters, saying that “he was the only person saved
    from the universal calamity; that he landed his big canoe on a high
    mountain in the west, where he now resides; that he had come to open
    the <em>medicine-lodge</em>, which must needs receive a present of some
    edged-tool from the owner of every wigwam, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span> it may be sacrificed
    to the water;” for he says, “if this is not done, there will be another
    flood, and no one will be saved, as it was with such tools that the big
    canoe was made.”</p>

  <p>Having visited every lodge or wigwam in the village, during the day,
    and having received such a present at each, as a hatchet, a knife, &amp;c.
    (which is undoubtedly always prepared and ready for the occasion), he
    returned at evening and deposited them in the <em>medicine-lodge</em>,
    where they remained until the afternoon of the last day of the
    ceremony, when, as the final or closing scene, they were thrown into
    the river in a deep place, from a bank thirty feet high, and in
    presence of the whole village; from whence they can never be recovered,
    and where they were, undoubtedly, <em>sacrificed</em> to the Spirit of
    the Water.</p>

  <p>During the first night of this strange character in the village, no one
    could tell where he slept; and every person, both old and young, and
    dogs, and all living things were kept within doors, and dead silence
    reigned every where. On the next morning at sunrise, however, he made
    his appearance again, and entered the <em>medicine-lodge</em>; and at his
    heels (in “<em>Indian file</em>,” <i>i. e.</i> single file, one following
    in another’s tracks) all the young men who were candidates for the
    self-tortures which were to be inflicted, and for the honours that were
    to be bestowed by the chiefs on those who could most manfully endure
    them. There were on this occasion about fifty young men who entered
    the lists, and as they went into the sacred lodge, each one’s body was
    chiefly naked, and covered with clay of different colours; some were
    red, others were yellow, and some were covered with white clay, giving
    them the appearance of white men. Each one of them carried in his right
    hand his <em>medicine-bag</em>—on his left arm, his shield of the bull’s
    hide—in his left hand, his bow and arrows, with his quiver slung on his
    back.</p>

  <p>When all had entered the lodge, they placed themselves in reclining
    postures around its sides, and each one had suspended over his head his
    respective weapons and <em>medicine</em>, presenting altogether, one of
    the most wild and picturesque scenes imaginable.</p>

  <p>Nu-mohk-muck-a-nah (the first or only man) was in the midst of them,
    and having lit and smoked his medicine-pipe for their success; and
    having addressed them in a short speech, stimulating and encouraging
    them to trust to the Great Spirit for His protection during the severe
    ordeal they were about to pass through; he called into the lodge an
    old medicine or mystery-man, whose body was painted yellow, and whom
    he appointed master of ceremonies during this occasion, whom they
    denominated in their language <i lang="mhq">O-kee-pah Ka-se-kah</i> (keeper or
    conductor of the ceremonies). He was appointed, and the authority
    passed by the presentation of the medicine-pipe, on which they consider
    hangs all the power of holding and conducting all these rites.</p>

  <p>After this delegated authority had thus passed over to the
    medicine-man; Nu-mohk-muck-a-nah shook hands with him, and bade him
    good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span> bye, saying “that he was going back to the mountains in the west,
    from whence he should assuredly return in just a year from that time,
    to open the lodge again.” He then went out of the lodge, and passing
    through the village, took formal leave of the chiefs in the same
    manner, and soon disappeared over the bluffs from whence he came. No
    more was seen of this surprising character during the occasion; but I
    shall have something yet to say of him and his strange office before I
    get through the Letter.</p>

  <p>To return to the lodge,—the medicine or mystery-man just appointed,
    and who had received his injunctions from Nu-mohk-muck-a-nah, was left
    sole conductor and keeper; and according to those injunctions, it was
    his duty to lie by a small fire in the centre of the lodge, with his
    medicine-pipe in his hand, crying to the Great Spirit incessantly,
    watching the young men, and preventing entirely their escape from the
    lodge, and all communication whatever with people outside, for the
    space of four days and nights, during which time they were not allowed
    to <em>eat</em>, to <em>drink</em>, or to <em>sleep</em>, preparatory to the
    excruciating self-tortures which they were to endure on the fourth day.</p>

  <p>I mentioned that I had made four paintings of these strange scenes,
    and the first one exhibits the interior of the medicine-lodge at this
    moment; with the young men all reclining around its sides, and the
    conductor or mystery-man lying by the fire, crying to the Great Spirit
    (<a href="#i_066"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 66</a>). It was just at this juncture that I was ushered
    into this sacred temple of their worship, with my companions, which
    was, undoubtedly, the first time that their devotions had ever been
    trespassed upon by the presence of pale faces; and in this instance had
    been brought about in the following strange and unexpected manner.</p>

  <p>I had most luckily for myself, painted a full-length portrait of this
    great magician or high-priest, but a day previous to the commencement
    of the ceremonies (in which I had represented him in the performance of
    some of his mysteries), with which he had been so exceedingly pleased
    as well as astonished (as “he could see its eyes move”), that I must
    needs be, in his opinion, deeply skilled in magic and mysteries, and
    well-entitled to a respectable rank in the craft, to which I had been
    at once elevated by the unanimous voice of the doctors, and regularly
    initiated, and styled <i lang="mhq">Te-ho-pee-nee-wash-ee-waska-pooska</i>, the
    <em>white medicine</em> (or Spirit) <em>painter</em>.</p>

  <p>With this very honourable degree which had just been conferred upon me,
    I was standing in front of the medicine-lodge early in the morning,
    with my companions by my side, endeavouring to get a peep, if possible,
    into its sacred interior; when this <em>master of ceremonies</em>,
    guarding and conducting its secrets, as I before described, came out
    of the door and taking me with a firm <em>professional</em> affection by
    the arm, led me into this <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>, which was strictly
    guarded from, even a peep or a gaze from the vulgar, by a vestibule
    of eight or ten feet in length, guarded with a double screen or door,
    and two or three dark and frowning centinels with spears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span> or war-clubs
    in their hands. I gave the wink to my companions as I was passing in,
    and the potency of my <em>medicine</em> was such as to gain them a quiet
    admission, and all of us were comfortably placed on elevated seats,
    which our conductor soon prepared for us.</p>

  <p>We were then in full view of everything that transpired in the lodge,
    having before us the scene exactly, which is represented in the first
    of the four pictures. To this seat we returned every morning at
    sunrise, and remained until sun-down for four days, the whole time
    which these strange scenes occupied.</p>

  <p>In addition to the preparations and arrangements of the interior of
    this sanctuary, as above described, there was a curious, though a very
    strict arrangement of buffalo and human skulls placed on the floor of
    the lodge, and between them (which were divided into two parcels),
    and in front of the reclining group of young candidates, was a small
    and very delicate scaffold, elevated about five feet from the ground,
    made of four posts or crotches, not larger than a gun-rod, and placed
    some four or five feet apart, supporting four equally delicate rods,
    resting in the crotches; thus forming the frame of the scaffold, which
    was completed by a number of still smaller and more delicate sticks,
    transversely resting upon them. On the centre of this little frame
    rested some small object, which I could not exactly understand from
    the distance of twenty or thirty feet which intervened between it and
    my eye. I started several times from my seat to approach it, but all
    eyes were instantly upon me, and every mouth in the assembly sent forth
    a hush—sh—! which brought me back to my seat again; and I at length
    quieted my stifled curiosity as well as I could, upon learning the
    fact, that so sacred was that object, and so important its secrets or
    mysteries, that not <em>I</em> alone, but even the young men, who were
    passing the ordeal, and all the village, save the conductor of the
    mysteries, were stopped from approaching it, or knowing what it was.</p>

  <p>This little mystery-thing, whatever it was, had the appearance from
    where I sat, of a small tortoise or frog lying on its back, with
    its head and legs quite extended, and wound and tasselled off with
    exceedingly delicate red and blue, and yellow ribbons or tassels, and
    other bright coloured ornaments; and seemed, from the devotions paid
    to it, to be the very nucleus of their mysteries—the <i>sanctissimus
    sanctorum</i>, from which seemed to emanate all the sanctity of
    their proceedings, and to which, all seemed to be paying the highest
    devotional respect.</p>

  <p>This strange, yet important <em>essence</em> of their mysteries, I made
    every enquiry about; but got no further information of, than what I
    could learn by my eyes, at the distance at which I saw it, and from
    the silent respect which I saw paid to it. I tried with the doctors,
    and all of the <em>fraternity</em> answered me, that that was “<em>great
    medicine</em>,” assuring me that it “could not be told.” So I quieted
    my curiosity as well as I could, by the full conviction that I had
    a <em>degree</em> or two yet to take before I could fathom all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span> the
    arcana of Indian superstitions; and that this little, seemingly
    wonderful, relic of antiquity, symbol of some grand event, or “secret
    too valuable to be told,” might have been at last nothing but a silly
    bunch of strings and toys, to which they pay some great peculiar
    regard; giving thereby to some favourite Spirit or essence an ideal
    existence, and which, when called upon to describe, they refuse to do
    so, calling it “<em>Great Medicine</em>,” for the very reason that there
    is nothing in it to reveal or describe.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>44</i></div>
  <figure id="i_067">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_067.jpg" alt="" />
     <figcaption>67</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Immediately under the little frame or scaffold described, and on the
    floor of the lodge was placed a knife, and by the side of it a bundle
    of splints or skewers, which were kept in readiness for the infliction
    of the cruelties directly to be explained. There were seen also, in
    this stage of the affair, a number of cords of rawhide hanging down
    from the top of the lodge, and passing through its roof, with which
    the young men were to be suspended by the splints passed through their
    flesh, and drawn up by men placed on the top of the lodge for the
    purpose, as will be described in a few moments.</p>

  <p>There were also four articles of great veneration and importance
    lying on the floor of the lodge, which were sacks, containing in
    each some three or four gallons of water. These also were objects of
    superstitious regard, and made with great labour and much ingenuity;
    each one of them being constructed of the skin of the buffalo’s neck,
    and most elaborately sewed together in the form of a large tortoise
    lying on its back, with a bunch of eagle’s quills appended to it as a
    tail; and each of them having a stick, shaped like a drum-stick, lying
    on them, with which, in a subsequent stage of these ceremonies, as
    will be seen, they are beaten upon by several of their mystery-men,
    as a part of the music for their strange dances and mysteries. By
    the side of these sacks which they call <i lang="mhq">Eeh-teeh-ka</i>, are two
    other articles of equal importance, which they call <i lang="mhq">Eeh-na-dee</i>
    (rattles), in the form of a gourd-shell made also of dried skins,
    and used at the same time as the others, in the music (or rather
    <em>noise</em> and <em>din</em>) for their dances, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>These four sacks of water have the appearance of very great
    antiquity; and by enquiring of my very ingenious friend and patron,
    the <em>medicine-man</em>, after the ceremonies were over, he very
    gravely told me, that “those four tortoises contained the waters from
    the four quarters of the world—that these waters had been contained
    therein ever since the settling down of the waters!” I did not think
    it best to advance any argument against so ridiculous a theory, and
    therefore could not even enquire or learn, at what period they had been
    instituted, or how often, or on what occasions, the water in them had
    been changed or replenished.</p>

  <p>I made several propositions, through my friend Mr. Kipp, the trader and
    interpreter, to purchase one of these strange things by offering them a
    very liberal price; to which I received in answer that these, and all
    the very numerous articles used in these ceremonies, being a <em>society
    property</em> were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span> <em>medicine</em>, and could not be sold for any
    consideration; so I abandoned all thoughts of obtaining anything,
    except what I have done by the <em>medicine</em> operation of my pencil,
    which was applied to everything, and even upon that they looked with
    decided distrust and apprehension, as a sort of theft or sacrilege.</p>

  <p>Such then was the group, and such the appearance of the interior of the
    medicine-lodge during the three first, and part of the fourth day also,
    of the Mandan religious ceremonies. The medicine-man with a group about
    him, of young aspirants who were under his sole controul, as was every
    article and implement to be used, and the sanctity of this solitary and
    gloomy looking place, which could not be trespassed upon by any man’s
    presence without his most sovereign permission.</p>

  <p>During the three first days of this solemn conclave, there were
    many very curious forms and amusements enacted in the open area
    in the middle of the village, and in front of the medicine-lodge,
    by other members of the community, one of which formed a material
    part or link of these strange ceremonials. This very curious and
    exceedingly grotesque part of their performance, which they denominated
    <i lang="mhq">Bel-lohck nah-pick</i> (the bull-dance) of which I have before
    spoken, as one of the avowed objects for which they held this annual
    fête; and to the strictest observance of which they attribute the
    coming of buffaloes to supply them with food during the season—is
    repeated four times during the first day, eight times on the second
    day, twelve times on the third day, and sixteen times on the fourth
    day; and always around the curb, or “<em>big canoe</em>,” of which I have
    before spoken.</p>

  <p>This subject I have selected for my second picture, and the principal
    actors in it were eight men, with the entire skins of buffaloes thrown
    over their backs, with the horns and hoofs and tails remaining on;
    their bodies in a horizontal position, enabling them to imitate the
    actions of the buffalo, whilst they were looking out of its eyes as
    through a mask (<a href="#i_067"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 67</a>).</p>

  <p>The bodies of these men were chiefly naked and all painted in the most
    extraordinary manner, with the nicest adherence to exact similarity;
    their limbs, bodies and faces, being in every part covered, either
    with black, red, or white paint. Each one of these strange characters
    had also a lock of buffalo’s hair tied around his ancles—in his right
    hand a rattle, and a slender white rod or staff, six feet long, in the
    other; and carried on his back, a bunch of green willow boughs about
    the usual size of a bundle of straw. These eight men, being divided
    into four pairs, took their positions on the four different sides of
    the curb or big canoe, representing thereby the four cardinal points;
    and between each group of them, with the back turned to the big canoe,
    was another figure, engaged in the same dance, keeping step with them,
    with a similar staff or wand in one hand and a rattle in the other, and
    (being four in number) answering again to the four cardinal points. The
    bodies of these four young men were chiefly naked, with no other dress
    upon them than a beautiful kelt (or quartz-quaw), around the waist,
    made of eagles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span> quills and ermine, and very splendid head-dresses
    made of the same materials. Two of these figures were painted entirely
    black with pounded charcoal and grease, whom they called the “firmament
    or night,” and the numerous white spots which were dotted all over
    their bodies, they called “stars.” The other two were painted from
    head to foot as red as vermilion could make them; these they said
    represented the day, and the white streaks which were painted up and
    down over their bodies, were “ghosts which the morning rays were
    chasing away.”</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>45</i></div>
  <figure id="i_068">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_068.jpg" alt="" />
     <figcaption>68</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>These twelve are the only persons actually engaged in this strange
    dance, which is each time repeated in the same form, without the
    slightest variation. There are, however, a great number of characters
    engaged in giving the whole effect and wildness to this strange and
    laughable scene, each one acting well his part, and whose offices,
    strange and inexplicable as they are, I will endeavour to point out
    and explain as well as I can, from what I saw, elucidated by their own
    descriptions.</p>

  <p>This most remarkable scene, then, which is witnessed more or less often
    on each day, takes place in presence of the whole nation, who are
    generally gathered around, on the tops of the wigwams or otherwise,
    as spectators, whilst the young men are reclining and fasting in the
    lodge as above described. On the first day, this “<em>bull-dance</em>” is
    given <em>once</em> to each of the cardinal points, and the medicine-man
    smokes his pipe in those directions. On the second day, <em>twice</em>
    to each; <em>three times</em> to each on the third day, and <em>four
    times</em> to each on the fourth. As a signal for the dancers and other
    characters (as well as the public) to assemble, the old man, master
    of ceremonies, with the medicine-pipe in hand, dances out of the
    lodge, singing (or rather crying) forth a most pitiful lament, until
    he approaches the big canoe, against which he leans, with the pipe in
    his hand, and continues to cry. At this instant, four very aged and
    patriarchal looking men, whose bodies are painted red, and who have
    been guarding the four sides of the lodge, enter it and bring out the
    four sacks of water, which they place near the big canoe, where they
    seat themselves by the side of them and commence thumping on them
    with the mallets or drumsticks which have been lying on them; and
    another brandishes and shakes the <i lang="mhq">eeh-na-dees</i> or rattles, and
    all unite to them their voices, raised to the highest pitch possible,
    as the music for the <em>bull-dance</em>, which is then commenced and
    continued for fifteen minutes or more in perfect time, and without
    cessation or intermission. When the music and dancing stop, which are
    always perfectly simultaneous, the whole nation raise the huzza! and a
    deafening shout of approbation; the master of ceremonies dances back to
    the medicine-lodge, and the old men return to their former place; the
    sacks of water, and all rest as before, until by the same method, they
    are again called into a similar action.</p>

  <p>The supernumeraries or other characters who play their parts in this
    grand spectacle, are numerous and well worth description. By the
    side of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span> big canoe are seen two men with the skins of grizzly
    bears thrown over them, using the skins as a mask, over their heads.
    These ravenous animals are continually growling and threatening to
    devour everything before them and interfering with the forms of their
    religious ceremony. To appease them, the women are continually bringing
    and placing before them dishes of meat, which are as often snatched up
    and carried to the prairie, by two men whose bodies are painted black
    and their heads white, whom they call bald eagles, who are darting by
    them and grasping their food from before them as they pass. These are
    again chased upon the plains by a hundred or more small boys, who are
    naked, with their bodies painted yellow and their heads white, whom
    they call <em>Cabris</em> or antelopes; who at length get the food away
    from them and devour it; thereby inculcating (perhaps) the beautiful
    moral, that by the dispensations of Providence, his bountiful gifts
    will fall at last to the hands of the innocent.</p>

  <p>During the intervals between these dances, all these characters, except
    those from the medicine-lodge, retire to a wigwam close by, which they
    use on the occasion also as a sacred place, being occupied exclusively
    by them while they are at rest, and also for the purpose of painting
    and ornamenting their bodies for the occasion.</p>

  <p>During each and every one of these dances, the old men who beat upon
    the sacks and sing, are earnestly chanting forth their supplications
    to the Great Spirit, for the continuation of his influence in sending
    them buffaloes to supply them with food during the year; they are
    administering courage and fortitude to the young men in the lodge,
    by telling them, that “the Great Spirit has opened his ears in their
    behalf—that the very atmosphere all about them is peace—that their
    women and children can hold the mouth of the grizzly bear—that they
    have invoked from day to day O-kee-hee-de (the Evil Spirit)—that they
    are still challenging him to come, and yet he has not dared to make his
    appearance!”</p>

  <p>But alas! in the last of these dances, on the fourth day, in the midst
    of all their mirth and joy, and about noon, and in the height of all
    these exultations, an instant scream burst forth from the tops of the
    lodges!—men, women, dogs and all, seemed actually to howl and shudder
    with alarm, as they fixed their glaring eye-balls upon the prairie
    bluff, about a mile in the west, down the side of which a man was seen
    descending at full speed towards the village! This strange character
    darted about in a zig-zag course in all directions on the prairie,
    like a boy in pursuit of a butterfly, until he approached the piquets
    of the village, when it was discovered that his body was entirely
    naked, and painted as black as a negro, with pounded charcoal and
    bear’s grease; his body was therefore everywhere of a shining black,
    except occasionally white rings of an inch or more in diameter, which
    were marked here and there all over him; and frightful indentures of
    white around his mouth, resembling canine teeth. Added to his hideous
    appearance, he gave the most frightful shrieks and screams as he
    dashed through the village<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span> and entered the terrified group, which was
    composed (in that quarter) chiefly of females, who had assembled to
    witness the amusements which were transpiring around the “big canoe.”</p>

  <p>This unearthly looking creature carried in his two hands a wand or
    staff of eight or nine feet in length, with a red ball at the end of
    it, which he continually slid on the ground a-head of him as he ran.
    All eyes in the village, save those of the persons engaged in the
    dance, were centred upon him, and he made a desperate rush towards
    the women, who screamed for protection as they were endeavouring to
    retreat; and falling in groups upon each other as they were struggling
    to get out of his reach. In this moment of general terror and alarm
    there was an instant check! and all for a few moments were as silent as
    death.</p>

  <p>The old master of ceremonies, who had run from his position at the
    big canoe, had met this monster of fiends, and having thrust the
    <em>medicine-pipe</em> before him, held him still and immoveable under
    its charm! This check gave the females an opportunity to get out of
    his reach, and when they were free from their danger, though all
    hearts beat yet with the instant excitement, their alarm soon cooled
    down into the most exorbitant laughter and shouts of applause at his
    sudden defeat, and the awkward and ridiculous posture in which he was
    stopped and held. The old man was braced stiff by his side, with his
    eye-balls glaring him in the face, whilst the medicine-pipe held in its
    mystic chains his <em>Satanic</em> Majesty, annulling all the powers of
    his magical wand, and also depriving him of the powers of locomotion!
    Surely no two human beings ever presented a more striking group than
    these two individuals did for a few moments, with their eye-balls
    set in direst mutual hatred upon each other; both struggling for the
    supremacy, relying on the potency of their medicine or mystery. The one
    held in check, with his body painted black, representing (or rather
    assuming to be) his sable majesty, O-kee-hee-de (the Evil Spirit),
    frowning everlasting vengeance on the other, who sternly gazed him back
    with a look of exultation and contempt, as he held him in check and
    disarmed under the charm of his sacred mystery-pipe.</p>

  <p>When the superior powers of the medicine-pipe (on which hang all these
    annual mysteries) had been thus fully tested and acknowledged, and
    the women had had requisite time to withdraw from the reach of this
    fiendish monster, the pipe was very gradually withdrawn from before
    him, and he seemed delighted to recover the use of his limbs again,
    and power of changing his position from the exceedingly unpleasant and
    really ridiculous one he appeared in, and was compelled to maintain,
    a few moments before; rendered more superlatively ridiculous and
    laughable, from the further information, which I am constrained to
    give, of the plight in which this demon of terror and vulgarity made
    his <i lang="fr">entrée</i> into the midst of the Mandan village, and to the
    centre and nucleus of their first and greatest religious ceremony.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

  <p>Then, to proceed: I said that this strange personage’s body was
    naked—was painted jet black with charcoal and bear’s grease, with a
    wand in his hands of eight feet in length with a red ball at the end of
    it, which he was rubbing about on the ground in front of him as he ran.
    In addition to this he had—<i lang="mhq">ung gee ah waheea notch,t oheks teha, ung
    gee an ung hutch tow a tow ah ches menny. Ung gee ah to to wun nee,
    ahkst to wan ee eigh’ s ta w.</i></p>

  <p>In this plight, in which I have not dared fully to represent him
    in the picture, he pursued the groups of females, spreading dismay
    and alarm wherever he went, and consequently producing the awkward
    and exceedingly laughable predicament in which he was placed by the
    sudden check from the medicine-pipe, as I have above stated, when
    all eyes were intently fixed upon him, and all joined in rounds of
    applause for the success of the magic spell that was placed upon
    him; all voices were raised in shouts of satisfaction at his defeat,
    and all eyes gazed upon him; of chiefs and of warriors—matrons and
    even of their tender-aged and timid daughters, whose education had
    taught them to receive the <em>moral</em> of these scenes without the
    shock of impropriety, that would have startled a more fastidious and
    consequently sensual-thinking people.</p>

  <p>After repeated attempts thus made, and thus defeated in several parts
    of the crowd, this blackened monster was retreating over the ground
    where the buffalo-dance was going on, and having (apparently, par
    accident) swaggered against one of the men placed under the skin of a
    buffalo and engaged in the “bull dance,” he started back, and placing
    himself in the attitude of a buffalo,—<i lang="mhq">hi ung ee a wahkstia, chee a
    nahk s tammee ung s towa; ee ung ee aht gwaht ee o nunghths tcha ho a,
    tummee oxt no ah, ughstono ah hi en en ah nahxt gwi aht gahtch gun ne.
    Gwee en on doatcht chee en aht gunne how how en ahxst tchu!</i></p>

  <p>After this he paid his visits to three others of the eight, in
    succession, receiving as before the deafening shouts of approbation
    which pealed from every mouth in the multitude, who were all praying to
    the Great Spirit to send them buffaloes to supply them with food during
    the season, and who attribute the coming of buffaloes for this purpose
    entirely to the strict and critical observance of this ridiculous and
    disgusting part of the ceremonies.</p>

  <p>During the half hour or so that he had been jostled about amongst man
    and beasts, to the great amusement and satisfaction of the lookers-on,
    he seemed to have become exceedingly exhausted, and anxiously looking
    out for some feasible mode of escape.</p>

  <p>In this awkward predicament he became the laughing-stock and butt
    for the women, who being no longer afraid of him, were gathering in
    groups around, to tease and tantalize him; and in the midst of this
    dilemma, which soon became a very sad one—one of the women, who stole
    up behind him with both hands full of yellow dirt—dashed it into his
    face and eyes, and all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span> over him, and his body being covered with
    grease, took instantly a different hue. He seemed heart-broken at this
    signal disgrace, and commenced crying most vehemently, when, <i lang="fr">a
    l’instant</i>, another caught his <em>wand</em> from his hand, and broke
    it across her knee. It was snatched for by others, who broke it still
    into bits, and then threw them at him. His power was now gone—his
    bodily strength was exhausted, and he made a bolt for the prairie—he
    dashed through the crowd, and made his way through the piquets on the
    back part of the village, where were placed for the purpose, an hundred
    or more women and girls, who escorted him as he ran on the prairie for
    half a mile or more, beating him with sticks, and stones, and dirt,
    and kicks, and cuffs, until he was at length seen escaping from their
    clutches, and making the best of his retreat over the prairie bluffs,
    from whence he first appeared.</p>

  <p>At the moment of this signal victory, and when all eyes lost sight of
    him as he disappeared over the bluffs, the whole village united their
    voices in shouts of satisfaction. The bull-dance then stopped, and
    preparations were instantly made for the commencement of the cruelties
    which were to take place within the lodge, leaving us to draw, from
    what had just transpired, the following beautiful moral:—</p>

  <p>That in the midst of their religious ceremonies, the Evil Spirit
    (O-kee-hee-de) made his entrée for the purpose of doing mischief, and
    of disturbing their worship—that he was held in check, and defeated by
    the superior influence and virtue of the <em>medicine-pipe</em>, and at
    last, driven in disgrace out of the village, by the very part of the
    community whom he came to abuse.</p>

  <p>At the close of this exciting scene, preparations were made, as above
    stated, by the return of the master of ceremonies and musicians to the
    medicine-lodge, where also were admitted at the same time a number
    of men, who were to be instruments of the cruelties to be inflicted;
    and also the chief and doctors of the tribe, who were to look on, and
    bear witness to, and decide upon, the comparative degree of fortitude,
    with which the young men sustain themselves in this most extreme and
    excruciating ordeal. The chiefs having seated themselves on one side
    of the lodge, dressed out in their robes and splendid head-dresses—the
    band of music seated and arranged themselves in another part; and the
    old master of ceremonies having placed himself in front of a small
    fire in the centre of the lodge, with his “big pipe” in his hands,
    and having commenced smoking to the Great Spirit, with all possible
    vehemence for the success of these aspirants, presented the subject
    for the third picture, which they call “<i lang="mhq">pohk-hong</i>,” the cutting
    scene (<a href="#i_068"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 68</a>). Around the sides of the lodge are seen,
    still reclining, as I have before mentioned, a part of the group,
    whilst others of them have passed the ordeal of self-tortures, and
    have been removed out of the lodge; and others still are seen in the
    very act of submitting to them, which were inflicted in the following
    manner:—After having removed the <i>sanctissimus sanctorum</i>, or
    little scaffold, of which I before spoke, and having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span> removed also the
    buffalo and human skulls from the floor, and attached them to the posts
    of the lodge; and two men having taken their positions near the middle
    of the lodge, for the purpose of inflicting the tortures—the one with
    the scalping-knife, and the other with the bunch of splints (which I
    have before mentioned) in his hand; one at a time of the young fellows,
    already emaciated with fasting, and thirsting, and waking, for nearly
    four days and nights, advanced from the side of the lodge, and placed
    himself on his hands and feet, or otherwise, as best suited for the
    performance of the operation, where he submitted to the cruelties in
    the following manner:—An inch or more of the flesh on each shoulder,
    or each breast was taken up between the thumb and finger by the man
    who held the knife in his right hand; and the knife, which had been
    ground sharp on both edges, and then hacked and notched with the blade
    of another, to make it produce as much pain as possible, was forced
    through the flesh below the fingers, and being withdrawn, was followed
    with a splint or skewer, from the other, who held a bunch of such in
    his left hand, and was ready to force them through the wound. There
    were then two cords lowered down from the top of the lodge (by men who
    were placed on the lodge outside, for the purpose), which were fastened
    to these splints or skewers, and they instantly began to haul him up;
    he was thus raised until his body was suspended from the ground where
    he rested, until the knife and a splint were passed through the flesh
    or integuments in a similar manner on each arm below the shoulder (over
    the <i>brachialis externus</i>), below the elbow (over the <i>extensor
    carpi radialis</i>), on the thighs (over the <i>vastus externus</i>),
    and below the knees (over the <i>peroneus</i>).</p>

  <p>In some instances they remained in a reclining position on the ground
    until this painful operation was finished, which was performed, in all
    instances, exactly on the same parts of the body and limbs; and which,
    in its progress, occupied some five or six minutes.</p>

  <p>Each one was then instantly raised with the cords, until the weight of
    his body was suspended by them, and then, while the blood was streaming
    down their limbs, the bystanders hung upon the splints each man’s
    appropriate shield, bow and quiver, &amp;c.; and in many instances, the
    skull of a buffalo with the horns on it, was attached to each lower arm
    and each lower leg, for the purpose, probably, of preventing by their
    great weight, the struggling, which might otherwise have taken place to
    their disadvantage whilst they were hung up.</p>

  <p>When these things were all adjusted, each one was raised higher by the
    cords, until these weights all swung clear from the ground, leaving
    his feet, in most cases, some six or eight feet above the ground. In
    this plight they at once became appalling and frightful to look at—the
    flesh, to support the weight of their bodies, with the additional
    weights which were attached to them, was raised six or eight inches by
    the skewers; and their heads sunk forward on the breasts, or thrown
    backwards, in a much more frightful condition, according to the way in
    which they were hung up.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>46</i></div>

  </figure>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

  <p>The unflinching fortitude, with which every one of them bore this part
    of the torture surpassed credulity; each one as the knife was passed
    through his flesh sustained an unchangeable countenance; and several of
    them, seeing me making sketches, beckoned me to look at their faces,
    which I watched through all this horrid operation, without being able
    to detect anything but the pleasantest smiles as they looked me in
    the eye, while I could hear the knife rip through the flesh, and feel
    enough of it myself, to start involuntary and uncontroullable tears
    over my cheeks.</p>

  <p>When raised to the condition above described, and completely suspended
    by the cords, the sanguinary hands, through which he had just passed,
    turned back to perform a similar operation on another who was
    ready, and each one in his turn passed into the charge of others,
    who instantly introduced him to a new and improved stage of their
    refinements in cruelty.</p>

  <p>Surrounded by imps and demons as they appear, a dozen or more, who seem
    to be concerting and devising means for his exquisite agony, gather
    around him, when one of the number advances towards him in a sneering
    manner, and commences turning him around with a pole which he brings
    in his hand for the purpose. This is done in a gentle manner at first;
    but gradually increased, when the brave fellow, whose proud spirit
    can controul its agony no longer, burst out in the most lamentable
    and heart-rending cries that the human voice is capable of producing,
    crying forth a prayer to the Great Spirit to support and protect him
    in this dreadful trial; and continually repeating his confidence
    in his protection. In this condition he is continued to be turned,
    faster and faster—and there is no hope of escape from it, nor chance
    for the slightest relief, until by fainting, his voice falters, and
    his struggling ceases, and he hangs, apparently, a still and lifeless
    corpse! When he is, by turning, gradually brought to this condition,
    which is generally done within ten or fifteen minutes, there is a close
    scrutiny passed upon him among his tormentors, who are checking and
    holding each other back as long as the least struggling or tremour can
    be discovered, lest he should be removed before he is (as they term it)
    “entirely dead.”</p>

  <p>When brought to this alarming and most frightful condition, and the
    turning has gradually ceased, as his voice and his strength have given
    out, leaving him to hang entirely still, and apparently lifeless; when
    his tongue is distended from his mouth, and his <em>medicine-bag</em>,
    which he has affectionately and superstitiously clung to with his left
    hand, has dropped to the ground; the signal is given to the men on top
    of the lodge, by gently striking the cord with the pole below, when
    they very gradually and carefully lower him to the ground.</p>

  <p>In this helpless condition he lies, like a loathsome corpse to look
    at, though in the keeping (as they call it) of the Great Spirit, whom
    he trusts will protect him, and enable him to get up and walk away.
    As soon as he is lowered to the ground thus, one of the bystanders
    advances, and pulls out the two splints or pins from the breasts and
    shoulders, thereby disengaging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span> him from the cords by which he has been
    hung up; but leaving all the others with their weights, &amp;c. hanging to
    his flesh.</p>

  <p>In this condition he lies for six or eight minutes, until he gets
    strength to rise and move himself, for no one is allowed to assist or
    offer him aid, as he is here enjoying the most valued privilege which a
    Mandan can boast of, that of “trusting his life to the keeping of the
    Great Spirit,” in this time of extreme peril.</p>

  <p>As soon as he is seen to get strength enough to rise on his hands and
    feet, and drag his body around the lodge, he crawls with the weights
    still hanging to his body, to another part of the lodge, where there is
    another Indian sitting with a hatchet in his hand, and a dried buffalo
    skull before him; and here, in the most earnest and humble manner, by
    holding up the little finger of his left hand to the Great Spirit, he
    expresses to Him, in a speech of a few words, his willingness to give
    it as a sacrifice; when he lays it on the dried buffalo skull, where
    the other chops it off near the hand, with a blow of the hatchet!</p>

  <p>Nearly all of the young men whom I saw passing this horrid ordeal, gave
    in the above manner, the little finger of the left hand; and I saw also
    several, who immediately afterwards (and apparently with very little
    concern or emotion), with a similar speech, extended in the same way,
    the <em>fore</em>-finger of the same hand, and that too was struck off;
    leaving on the left hand only the two middle fingers and the thumb;
    all which they deem absolutely essential for holding the bow, the only
    weapon for the left hand.</p>

  <p>One would think that this mutilation had thus been carried quite far
    enough; but I have since examined several of the head chiefs and
    dignitaries of the tribe, who have also given, in this manner, the
    little finger of the right hand, which is considered by them to be a
    much greater sacrifice than both of the others; and I have found also
    a number of their most famous men, who furnish me incontestible proof,
    by five or six corresponding scars on each arm, and each breast, and
    each leg, that they had so many times in their lives submitted to this
    almost incredible operation, which seems to be optional with them;
    and the oftener they volunteer to go through it, the more famous they
    become in the estimation of their tribe.</p>

  <p>No bandages are applied to the fingers which have been amputated, nor
    any arteries taken up; nor is any attention whatever, paid to them or
    the other wounds; but they are left (as they say) “for the Great Spirit
    to cure, who will surely take good care of them.” It is a remarkable
    fact (which I learned from a close inspection of their wounds from day
    to day) that the bleeding is but very slight and soon ceases, probably
    from the fact of their extreme exhaustion and debility, caused by want
    of sustenance and sleep, which checks the natural circulation, and
    admirably at the same time prepares them to meet the severity of these
    tortures without the same degree of sensibility and pain, which, under
    other circumstances, might result in inflammation and death.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

  <p>During the whole of the time of this cruel part of these most
    extraordinary inflictions, the chiefs and dignitaries of the tribe are
    looking on, to decide who are the hardiest and “stoutest hearted”—who
    can hang the longest by his flesh before he faints, and who will be
    soonest up, after he has been down; that they may know whom to appoint
    to lead a war-party, or place at the most honourable and desperate
    post. The four old men are incessantly beating upon the sacks of water
    and singing the whole time, with their voices strained to the highest
    key, vaunting forth, for the encouragement of the young men, the power
    and efficacy of the <em>medicine-pipe</em>, which has disarmed the
    monster O-kee-hee-de (or Evil Spirit), and driven him from the village,
    and will be sure to protect them and watch over them through their
    present severe trial.</p>

  <p>As soon as six or eight had passed the ordeal as above described,
    they were led out of the lodge, with their weights hanging to their
    flesh, and dragging on the ground, to undergo another, and a still
    more appalling mode of suffering in the centre of the village, and in
    presence of the whole nation, in the manner as follows:—</p>

  <p>The signal for the commencement of this part of the cruelties was
    given by the old master of ceremonies, who again ran out as in
    the buffalo-dance, and leaning against the big canoe, with his
    <em>medicine-pipe</em> in his hand, began to cry. This was done several
    times in the afternoon, as often as there were six or eight who had
    passed the ordeal just described within the lodge, who were then taken
    out in the open area, in the presence of the whole village, with the
    buffalo skulls and other weights attached to their flesh, and dragging
    on the ground! There were then in readiness, and prepared for the
    purpose, about twenty young men, selected of equal height and equal
    age; with their bodies chiefly naked, with beautiful (and similar)
    head-dresses of war-eagles’ quills, on their heads, and a wreath made
    of willow boughs held in the hands between them, connecting them
    in a chain or circle in which they ran around the big canoe, with
    all possible speed, raising their voices in screams and yelps to
    the highest pitch that was possible, and keeping the curb or <em>big
    canoe</em> in the centre, as their nucleus.</p>

  <p>Then were led forward the young men who were further to suffer, and
    being placed at equal distances apart, and outside of the ring just
    described, each one was taken in charge of two athletic young men,
    fresh and strong, who stepped up to him, one on each side, and by
    wrapping a broad leather strap around his wrists, without tying it,
    grasped it firm underneath the hand, and stood prepared for what they
    call <i lang="mhq">Eh-ke-nah-ka-nah-pick</i> (the last race, <a href="#i_069"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 69</a>).
    This, the spectator looking on would suppose was most correctly named,
    for he would think it was the last race they could possibly run in this
    world.</p>

  <p>In this condition they stand, pale and ghastly, from abstinence and
    loss of blood, until all are prepared, and the word is given, when
    all start and run around, outside of the other ring; and each poor
    fellow, with his weights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> dragging on the ground, and his furious
    conductors by his side, who hurry him forward by the wrists, struggles
    in the desperate emulation to run longer without “dying” (as they
    call it) than his comrades, who are fainting around him and sinking
    down, like himself, where their bodies are dragged with all possible
    speed, and often with their faces in the dirt. In the commencement of
    this dance or race they all start at a moderate pace, and their speed
    being gradually increased, the pain becomes so excruciating that their
    languid and exhausted frames give out, and they are dragged by their
    wrists until they are disengaged from the weights that were attached
    to their flesh, and this must be done by such violent force as to
    tear the flesh out with the splint, which (as they say) can never be
    pulled out endwise, without greatly offending the Great Spirit and
    defeating the object for which they have thus far suffered. The splints
    or skewers which are put through the breast and the shoulders, take
    up a part of the pectoral or trapezius muscle, which is necessary for
    the support of the great weight of their bodies, and which, as I have
    before mentioned, are withdrawn as soon as he is lowered down—but all
    the others, on the legs and arms, seem to be very ingeniously passed
    through the flesh and integuments without taking up the muscle, and
    even these, to be broken out, require so strong and so violent a force
    that most of the poor fellows fainted under the operation, and when
    they were freed from the last of the buffalo skulls and other weights,
    (which was often done by some of the bystanders throwing the weight of
    their bodies on to them as they were dragging on the ground) they were
    in every instance dropped by the persons who dragged them, and their
    bodies were left, appearing like nothing but a mangled and a loathsome
    corpse! At this strange and frightful juncture, the two men who had
    dragged them, fled through the crowd and away upon the prairie, as if
    they were guilty of some enormous crime, and were fleeing from summary
    vengeance.</p>

  <p>Each poor fellow, having thus patiently and manfully endured the
    privations and tortures devised for him, and (in this last struggle
    with the most appalling effort) torn himself loose from them and his
    tormentors, he lies the second time, in the “keeping (as he terms it)
    of the Great Spirit,” to whom he issues his repeated prayers, and
    entrusts his life: and in whom he reposes the most implicit confidence
    for his preservation and recovery. As an evidence of this, and of the
    high value which these youths set upon this privilege, there is no
    person, not a relation or a chief of the tribe, who is allowed, or who
    would dare, to step forward to offer an aiding hand, even to save his
    life; for not only the rigid customs of the nation, and the pride of
    the individual who has entrusted his life to the keeping of the Great
    Spirit, would sternly reject such a tender; but their superstition,
    which is the strongest of all arguments in an Indian community, would
    alone, hold all the tribe in fear and dread of interfering, when
    they consider they have so good a reason to believe that the Great
    Spirit has undertaken the special care and protection of his devoted
    worshippers.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>

  <p>In this “last race,” which was the struggle that finally closed their
    sufferings, each one was dragged until he fainted, and was thus left,
    looking more like the dead than the living: and thus each one laid,
    until, by the aid of the Great Spirit, he was in a few minutes seen
    gradually rising, and at last reeling and staggering, like a drunken
    man, through the crowd (which made way for him) to his wigwam, where
    his friends and relatives stood ready to take him into hand and restore
    him.</p>

  <p>In this frightful scene, as in the buffalo-dance, the whole nation
    was assembled as spectators, and all raised the most piercing and
    violent yells and screams they could possibly produce, to drown the
    cries of the suffering ones, that no heart could even be touched with
    sympathy for them. I have mentioned before, that six or eight of the
    young men were brought from the medicine-lodge at a time, and when
    they were thus passed through this shocking ordeal, the medicine-men
    and the chiefs returned to the interior, where as many more were soon
    prepared, and underwent a similar treatment; and after that another
    batch, and another, and so on, until the whole number, some forty-five
    or fifty had run in this sickening circle, and, by leaving their
    weights, had opened the flesh for honourable scars. I said <em>all</em>,
    but there was one poor fellow though (and I shudder to tell it), who
    was dragged around and around the circle, with the skull of an elk
    hanging to the flesh on one of his legs,—several had jumped upon it,
    but to no effect, for the splint was under the sinew, which could not
    be broken. The dragging became every instant more and more furious, and
    the apprehensions for the poor fellow’s life, apparent by the piteous
    howl which was set up for him by the multitude around; and at last the
    medicine-man ran, with his medicine-pipe in his hand, and held them in
    check, when the body was dropped, and left upon the ground, with the
    skull yet hanging to it. The boy, who was an extremely interesting and
    fine-looking youth, soon recovered his senses and his strength, looking
    deliberately at his torn and bleeding limbs; and also with the most
    pleasant smile of defiance, upon the misfortune which had now fallen to
    his peculiar lot, crawled through the crowd (instead of walking, which
    they are never again at liberty to do until the flesh is torn out, and
    the article left) to the prairie, and over which, for the distance of
    half a mile, to a sequestered spot, without any attendant, where he
    laid three days and three nights, yet longer, without food, and praying
    to the Great Spirit, until suppuration took place in the wound, and
    by the decaying of the flesh the weight was dropped, and the splint
    also, which he dare not extricate in another way. At the end of this,
    he crawled back to the village on his hands and knees, being too much
    emaciated to walk, and begged for something to eat, which was at once
    given him, and he was soon restored to health.</p>

  <p>These extreme and difficult cases often occur, and I learn that in such
    instances the youth has it at his option to get rid of the weight that
    is thus left upon him, in such way as he may choose, and some of those
    modes are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span> far more extraordinary than the one which I have just named.
    Several of the Traders, who have been for a number of years in the
    habit of seeing this part of the ceremony, have told me that two years
    since, when they were looking on, there was one whose flesh on the arms
    was so strong that the weights could not be left, and he dragged them
    with his body to the river by the side of the village, where he set a
    stake fast in the ground on the top of the bank, and fastening cords
    to it, he let himself half-way down a perpendicular wall of rock, of
    twenty-five or thirty feet, where the weight of his body was suspended
    by the two cords attached to the flesh of his arms. In this awful
    condition he hung for several days, equi-distant from the top of the
    rock and the deep water below, into which he at last dropped and saved
    himself by swimming ashore!</p>

  <p>I need record no more of these shocking and disgusting instances,
    of which I have already given enough to convince the world of the
    correctness of the established fact of the Indian’s superior stoicism
    and power of endurance, although some recent writers have, from motives
    of envy, from ignorance, or something else, taken great pains to cut
    the poor Indian short in everything, and in <em>this</em>, even as if it
    were a virtue.</p>

  <p>I am ready to accord to them in this particular, the palm; the credit
    of outdoing anything and everybody, and of enduring more than civilized
    man ever aspired to or ever thought of. My heart has sickened also
    with disgust for so abominable and ignorant a custom, and still I
    stand ready with all my heart, to excuse and forgive them for adhering
    so strictly to an ancient celebration, founded in superstitions and
    mysteries, of which they know not the origin, and constituting a
    material part and feature in the code and forms of their religion.</p>

  <p>Reader, I will return with you a moment to the medicine-lodge, which is
    just to be closed, and then we will indulge in some general reflections
    upon what has passed, and in what, and for what purposes this strange
    batch of mysteries has been instituted and perpetuated.</p>

  <p>After these young men, who had for the last four days occupied the
    medicine-lodge, had been operated on, in the manner above described,
    and taken out of it, the old medicine-man, master of ceremonies,
    returned, (still crying to the Great Spirit) sole tenant of that sacred
    place, and brought out the “edged tools,” which I before said had been
    collected at the door of every man’s wigwam, to be given as a sacrifice
    to the water, and leaving the lodge securely fastened, he approached
    the bank of the river, when all the medicine-men attended him, and all
    the nation were spectators; and in their presence he threw them from a
    high bank into very deep water, from which they cannot be recovered,
    and where they are, correctly speaking, made a sacrifice to the water.
    This part of the affair took place just exactly at sun-down, and
    closed the scene, being the end or finale of the <em>Mandan religious
    ceremony</em>.</p>

  <p class="mt2">The strange country that I am in—its excitements—its accidents and
    wild incidents which startle me at almost every moment, prevent me
    from any very elaborate disquisition upon the above remarkable events
    at present; and even had I all the time and leisure of a country
    gentleman, and all the additional information which I am daily
    procuring, and daily expect to procure hereafter in explanation of
    these unaccountable mysteries, yet do I fear that there would be
    that inexplicable difficulty that hangs over most of the customs and
    traditions of these simple people, who have no history to save facts
    and systems from falling into the most absurd and disjointed fable and
    ignorant fiction.</p>

  <p>What few plausible inferences I have as yet been able to draw from the
    above strange and peculiar transactions I will set forth, but with
    some diffidence, hoping and trusting that by further intimacy and
    familiarity with these people I may yet arrive at more satisfactory and
    important results.</p>

  <p>That these people should have a tradition of the Flood is by no means
    surprising; as I have learned from every tribe I have visited, that
    they all have some high mountain in their vicinity, where they insist
    upon it the big canoe landed; but that these people should hold an
    annual celebration of the event, and the season of that decided by such
    circumstances as the full leaf of the willow, and the medicine-lodge
    opened by such a man as Nu-mohk-muck-a-nah (who appears to be a white
    man), and making his appearance “from the high-mountains in the West;”
    and some other circumstances, is surely a very remarkable thing, and
    requires some extraordinary attention.</p>

  <p>This Nu-mohk-muck-a-nah (first or only man) is undoubtedly some mystery
    or medicine-man of the tribe, who has gone out on the prairie on the
    evening previous, and having dressed and painted himself for the
    occasion, comes into the village in the morning, endeavouring to keep
    up the semblance of reality; for their tradition says, that at a very
    ancient period such a man did actually come from the West—that his
    body was of the white colour, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span> this man’s body is represented—that
    he wore a robe of four white wolf skins—his head-dress was made of two
    raven’s skins—and in his left hand was a huge pipe. He said, “he was at
    one time the only man—he told them of the destruction of every thing on
    the earth’s surface by water—that he stopped in his <em>big canoe</em> on
    a high mountain in the West, where he landed and was saved.”</p>

  <p>“That the Mandans, and all other people were bound to make yearly
    sacrifices of some edged-tools to the water, for of such things the
    big canoe was made. That he instructed the Mandans how to build
    their medicine-lodge, and taught them also the forms of these annual
    ceremonies; and told them that as long as they made these sacrifices,
    and performed their rites to the full letter, they might be assured of
    the fact, that they would be the favourite people of the Almighty, and
    would always have enough to eat and drink; and that so soon as they
    should depart in one tittle from these forms, they might be assured,
    that their race would decrease, and finally run out; and that they
    might date their nation’s calamity to that omission or neglect.”</p>

  <p>These people have, no doubt, been long living under the dread of such
    an injunction, and in the fear of departing from it; and while they are
    living in total ignorance of its origin, the world must remain equally
    ignorant of much of its meaning, as they needs must be of all Indian
    customs resting on ancient traditions, which soon run into fables,
    having lost all their system, by which they might have been construed.</p>

  <p>This strange and unaccountable custom, is undoubtedly peculiar to the
    Mandans; although, amongst the Minatarees, and some others of the
    neighbouring tribes, they have seasons of abstinence and self-torture,
    somewhat similar, but bearing no other resemblance to this than a mere
    feeble effort or form of imitation.</p>

  <p>It would seem from their tradition of the willow branch, and the dove,
    that these people must have had some proximity to some part of the
    civilized world; or that missionaries or others have been formerly
    among them, inculcating the Christian religion and the Mosaic account
    of the Flood; which is, in this and some other respects, decidedly
    different from the theory which most natural people have distinctly
    established of that event.</p>

  <p>There are other strong, and almost decisive proofs in my opinion, in
    support of the assertion, which are to be drawn from the diversity of
    colour in their hair and complexions, as I have before described, as
    well as from their tradition just related, of the “<em>first or only
    man</em>,” whose body was white, and who came from the West, telling
    them of the destruction of the earth by water, and instructing them in
    the forms of these mysteries; and, in addition to the above, I will add
    the two following very curious stories, which I had from several of
    their old and dignified chiefs, and which are, no doubt, standing and
    credited traditions of the tribe.</p>

  <p>“The Mandans (people of the pheasants) were the first people created
    in the world, and they originally lived inside of the earth; they
    raised many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span> vines, and one of them had grown up through a hole in
    the earth, over head, and one of their young men climbed up it until
    he came out on the top of the ground, on the bank of the river, where
    the Mandan village stands. He looked around, and admired the beautiful
    country and prairies about him—saw many buffaloes—killed one with his
    bow and arrows, and found that its meat was good to eat. He returned,
    and related what he had seen; when a number of others went up the vine
    with him, and witnessed the same things. Amongst those who went up,
    were two very pretty young women, who were favourites of the chiefs,
    because they were virgins; and amongst those who were trying to get up,
    was a very large and fat woman, who was ordered by the chiefs not to go
    up, but whose curiosity led her to try it as soon as she got a secret
    opportunity, when there was no one present. When she got part of the
    way up, the vine broke under the great weight of her body, and let her
    down. She was very much hurt by the fall, but did not die. The Mandans
    were very sorry about this; and she was disgraced for being the cause
    of a very great calamity, which she had brought upon them, and which
    could never be averted; for no more could ever ascend, nor could those
    descend who had got up; but they built the Mandan village, where it
    formerly stood, a great ways below on the river; and the remainder of
    the people live under ground to this day.”</p>

  <p>The above tradition is told with great gravity by their chiefs and
    doctors or mystery-men; and the latter profess to hear their friends
    talk through the earth at certain times and places, and even consult
    them for their opinions and advice on many important occasions.</p>

  <p>The next tradition runs thus:—</p>

  <p>“At a very ancient period, O-kee-hee-de (the Evil Spirit, the black
    fellow mentioned in the religious ceremonies) came to the Mandan
    village with Nu-mohk-muck-a-nah (the first or only man) from the West,
    and sat down by a woman who had but one eye, and was hoeing corn. Her
    daughter, who was very pretty came up to her, and the Evil Spirit
    desired her to go and bring some water; but wished that before she
    started, she would come to him and eat some buffalo meat. He told her
    to take a piece out of his side, which she did and ate it, which proved
    to be buffalo-fat. She then went for the water, which she brought, and
    met them in the village where they had walked, and they both drank of
    it—nothing more was done.</p>

  <p>“The friends of the girl soon after endeavoured to disgrace her, by
    telling her that she was <i lang="fr">enciente</i>, which she did not deny. She
    declared her innocence at the same time, and boldly defied any man
    in the village to come forward and accuse her. This raised a great
    excitement in the village, and as no one could stand forth to accuse
    her, she was looked upon as <em>great medicine</em>. She soon after went
    off secretly to the upper Mandan village, where the child was born.</p>

  <p>“Great search was made for her before she was found; as it was
    expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span> that the child would also be great <em>medicine</em> or
    mystery, and of great importance to the existence and welfare of the
    tribe. They were induced to this belief from the very strange manner
    of its conception and birth, and were soon confirmed in it from
    the wonderful things which it did at an early age. They say, that
    amongst other miracles which he performed, when the Mandans were like
    to starve, he gave them four buffalo bulls, which filled the whole
    village—leaving as much meat as there was before they had eaten; saying
    that these four bulls would supply them for ever. Nu-mohk-muck-a-nah
    (the first or only man) was bent on the destruction of the child, and
    after making many fruitless searches for it, found it hidden in a dark
    place, and put it to death by throwing it into the river.</p>

  <p>“When O-kee-hee-de (the Evil Spirit) heard of the death of this child,
    he sought for Nu-mohk-muck-a-nah with intent to kill him. He traced
    him a long distance, and at length found him at <em>Heart River</em>,
    about seventy miles below the village, with the big medicine-pipe
    in his hand, the charm or mystery of which protects him from all of
    his enemies. They soon agreed, however, to become friends, smoked
    the big pipe together, and returned to the Mandan village. The Evil
    Spirit was satisfied; and Nu-mohk-muck-a-nah told the Mandans never
    to pass Heart River to live, for it was the centre of the world,
    and to live beyond it would be destruction to them; and he named it
    <i lang="mhq">Nat-com-pa-sa-hah</i> (heart or centre of the world).”</p>

  <p>Such are a few of the principal traditions of these people, which I
    have thought proper to give in this place, and I have given them in
    their own way, with all the imperfections and absurd inconsistencies
    which should be expected to characterize the history of all ignorant
    and superstitious people who live in a state of simple and untaught
    nature, with no other means of perpetuating historical events, than by
    oral traditions.</p>

  <p>I advance these vague stories then, as I have done, and shall do in
    other instances, not in support of any theory, but merely as I have
    heard them related by the Indians; and preserved them, as I have
    everything else that I could meet in the Indian habits and character,
    for the information of the world, who may get more time to theorize
    than I have at present; and who may consider better than I can, how far
    such traditions should be taken as evidence of the facts, that these
    people have for a long period preserved and perpetuated an imperfect
    knowledge of the Deluge—of the appearance and death of a Saviour—and of
    the transgressions of mother Eve.</p>

  <p>I am not yet able to learn from these people whether they have any
    distinct theory of the creation; as they seem to date nothing further
    back than their own existence as a people; saying (as I have before
    mentioned), that they were the first people created; involving the
    glaring absurdities that they were the only people on earth before
    the Flood, and the only one saved was a white man; or that they were
    created inside of the earth, as their tradition says; and that they
    did not make their appearance on its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span> outer surface until after the
    Deluge. When an Indian story is told, it is like all other gifts, “to
    be taken for what it is worth,” and for any seeming inconsistency in
    their traditions there is no remedy; for as far as I have tried to
    reconcile them by reasoning with, or questioning them, I have been
    entirely defeated; and more than that, have generally incurred their
    distrust and ill-will. One of the Mandan doctors told me very gravely
    a few days since, that the earth was a large tortoise, that it carried
    the dirt on its back—that a tribe of people, who are now dead, and
    whose faces were white, used to dig down very deep in this ground to
    catch <em>badgers</em>; and that one day they stuck a knife through the
    tortoise-shell, and it sunk down so that the water ran over its back,
    and drowned all but one man. And on the next day while I was painting
    his portrait, he told me there were <em>four tortoises</em>,—one in the
    North—one in the East—one in the South, and one in the West; that each
    one of these rained ten days, and the water covered over the earth.</p>

  <p>These ignorant and conflicting accounts, and both from the same man,
    give as good a demonstration, perhaps, of what I have above mentioned,
    as to the inefficiency of Indian traditions as anything I could at
    present mention. They might, perhaps, have been in this instance
    however the creeds of different sects, or of different priests amongst
    them, who often advance diametrically opposite theories and traditions
    relative to history and mythology.</p>

  <p>And however ignorant and ridiculous they may seem, they are yet worthy
    of a little further consideration, as relating to a number of curious
    circumstances connected with the unaccountable religious ceremonies
    which I have just described.</p>

  <p>The Mandan chiefs and doctors, in all their feasts, where the pipe
    is lit and about to be passed around, deliberately propitiate the
    good-will and favour of the Great Spirit, by extending the stem of
    the pipe <em>upwards</em> before they smoke it themselves; and also as
    deliberately and as strictly offering the stem to the four <em>cardinal
    points</em> in succession, and then drawing a whiff through it, passing
    it around amongst the group.</p>

  <p>The <em>annual religious ceremony</em> invariably lasts <em>four</em>
    days, and the other following circumstances attending these strange
    forms, and seeming to have some allusion to the <em>four</em> cardinal
    points, or the “four tortoises,” seem to me to be worthy of further
    notice. <em>Four</em> men are selected by Nu-mohk-muck-a-nah (as I
    have before said), to cleanse out and prepare the medicine-lodge
    for the occasion—one he calls from the <em>north</em> part of the
    village—one from the <em>east</em>—one from the <em>south</em>, and one
    from the <em>west</em>. The <em>four</em> sacks of water, in form of large
    tortoises, resting on the floor of the lodge and before described,
    would seem to be typical of the same thing; and also the <em>four</em>
    buffalo, and the <em>four</em> human skulls resting on the floor of the
    same lodge—the <em>four</em> couples of dancers in the “bull-dance,” as
    before described, and also the <em>four</em> intervening dancers in the
    same dance, and also described</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

  <p>The bull-dance in front of the medicine-lodge, repeated on the
    <em>four</em> days, is danced <em>four</em> times on the first day,
    <em>eight</em> times on the second, <em>twelve</em> times on the third,
    and <em>sixteen</em> times on the <em>fourth</em>; (adding <em>four</em>
    dances on each of the <em>four</em> days,) which added together make
    <em>forty</em>, the exact number of days that it rained upon the earth,
    according to the Mosaic account, to produce the Deluge. There are
    <em>four</em> sacrifices of black and blue cloths erected over the door
    of the medicine-lodge—the visits of O-kee-hee-de (or Evil Spirit)
    were paid to <em>four</em> of the buffaloes in the buffalo-dance, as
    above described; and in every instance, the young men who underwent
    the tortures before explained, had <em>four</em> splints or skewers
    run through the flesh on their legs—<em>four</em> through the arms and
    <em>four</em> through the body.</p>

  <p>Such is a brief account of these strange scenes which I have just been
    witnessing, and such my brief history of the Mandans. I might write
    much more on them, giving yet a volume on their stories and traditions;
    but it would be a volume of fables, and scarce worth recording. A
    nation of Indians in their primitive condition, where there are no
    historians, have but a temporary historical existence, for the reasons
    above advanced, and their history, what can be certainly learned of it,
    may be written in a very small compass.</p>

  <p>I have dwelt longer on the history and customs of these people than I
    have or shall on any other tribe, in all probability, and that from the
    fact that I have found them a very peculiar people, as will have been
    seen by my notes.</p>

  <p>From these very numerous and striking peculiarities in their personal
    appearance—their customs—traditions and language, I have been led
    conclusively to believe that they are a people of decidedly a different
    origin from that of any other tribe in these regions.</p>

  <p>From these reasons, as well as from the fact that they are a small and
    feeble tribe, against whom the powerful tribe of Sioux are waging a
    deadly war with the prospect of their extermination; and who with their
    limited numbers, are not likely to hold out long in their struggle for
    existence, I have taken more pains to pourtray their whole character,
    than my limited means will allow me to bestow upon other tribes.</p>

  <p>From the ignorant and barbarous and disgusting customs just recited,
    the world would naturally infer, that these people must be the most
    cruel and inhuman beings in the world—yet, such is not the case, and it
    becomes my duty to say it; a better, more honest, hospitable and kind
    people, as a community, are not to be found in the world. No set of men
    that ever I associated with have better hearts than the Mandans, and
    none are quicker to embrace and welcome a white man than they are—none
    will press him closer to his bosom, that the pulsation of his heart may
    be felt, than a Mandan; and no man in any country will keep his word
    and guard his honour more closely.</p>

  <p>The shocking and disgusting custom that I have just described, sickens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
    the heart and even the stomach of a traveller in the country, and he
    weeps for their ignorance—he pities them with all his heart for their
    blindness, and laments that the light of civilization, of agriculture
    and religion cannot be extended to them, and that their hearts which
    are good enough, could not be turned to embrace something more rational
    and conducive to their true happiness.</p>

  <p>Many would doubtless ask, whether such a barbarous custom could be
    eradicated from these people? and whether their thoughts and tastes,
    being turned to agriculture and religion, could be made to abandon the
    dark and random channel in which they are drudging, and made to flow in
    the light and life of civilization?</p>

  <p>To this query I answer <em>yes</em>. Although this is a custom of long
    standing, being a part of their religion; and probably valued as one
    of their dearest rights; and notwithstanding the difficulty of making
    inroads upon the religion of a people in whose country there is no
    severence of opinions, and consequently no division into different
    sects, with different creeds to shake their faith; I still believe,
    and I <em>know</em>, that by a judicious and persevering effort, this
    abominable custom, and others, might be extinguished, and the beautiful
    green fields about the Mandan village might be turned into productive
    gardens, and the waving green bluffs that are spread in the surrounding
    distance, might be spotted with lowing kine, instead of the sneaking
    wolves and the hobbled war-horses that are now stalking about them.</p>

  <p>All ignorant and superstitious people, it is a well-known fact, are
    the most fixed and stubborn in their religious opinions, and perhaps
    the most difficult to divert from their established belief, from the
    very fact that they are the most difficult to reason with. Here is
    an ignorant race of human beings, who have from time immemorial been
    in the habit of worshipping in their own way, and of enjoying their
    religious opinions without ever having heard any one to question their
    correctness; and in those opinions they are quiet and satisfied, and
    it requires a patient, gradual, and untiring effort to convince such
    a people that they are wrong, and to work the desired change in their
    belief, and consequently in their actions.</p>

  <p>It is decidedly my opinion, however, that such a thing <em>can</em> be
    done, and I do not believe there is a race of wild people on earth
    where the experiment could be more successfully made than amongst the
    kind and hospitable Mandans, nor any place where the Missionary labours
    of pious and industrious men would be more sure to succeed, or more
    certain to be rewarded in the world to come.</p>

  <p>I deem such a trial of patience and perseverance with these people of
    great importance, and well worth the experiment. One which I shall hope
    soon to see accomplished, and which, if properly conducted, I am sure
    will result in success. Severed as they are from the contaminating and
    counteracting vices which oppose and thwart most of the best efforts
    of the Missionaries along the frontier, and free from the almost fatal
    prejudices which they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span> there to contend with; they present a
    better field for the labours of such benevolent teachers than they
    have yet worked in, and a far better chance than they have yet had of
    proving to the world that the poor Indian is not a brute—that he is
    a human and humane being, that he is capable of improvement—and that
    his mind is a beautiful blank on which anything can be written if the
    proper means be taken.</p>

  <p>The Mandans being but a small tribe, of two thousand only, and living
    all in two villages, in sight of each other, and occupying these
    permanently, without roaming about like other neighbouring tribes,
    offer undoubtedly, the best opportunity for such an experiment of any
    tribe in the country. The land about their villages is of the best
    quality for ploughing and grazing, and the water just such as would
    be desired. Their villages are fortified with piquets or stockades,
    which protect them from the assaults of their enemies at home; and
    the introduction of agriculture (which would supply them with the
    necessaries and luxuries of life, without the necessity of continually
    exposing their lives to their more numerous enemies on the plains, when
    they are seeking in the chase the means of their subsistence) would
    save them from the continual wastes of life, to which, in their wars
    and the chase they are continually exposed, and which are calculated
    soon to result in their extinction.</p>

  <p>I deem it not folly nor idle to say that these people <em>can be
    saved</em>, nor officious to suggest to some of the very many excellent
    and pious men, who are almost throwing away the best energies of their
    lives along the debased frontier, that if they would introduce the
    ploughshare and their prayers amongst these people, who are so far
    separated from the taints and contaminating vices of the frontier, they
    would soon see their most ardent desires accomplished and be able to
    solve to the world the perplexing enigma, by presenting a nation of
    savages, civilized and christianized (and consequently <em>saved</em>),
    in the heart of the American wilderness.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MINATAREE VILLAGE, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after witnessing the curious scenes described in the former
    Letters, I changed my position to the place from whence I am now
    writing—to the village of the Minatarees, which is also located on
    the west bank of the Missouri river, and only eight miles above the
    Mandans. On my way down the river in my canoe, I passed this village
    without attending to their earnest and clamorous invitations for me to
    come ashore, and it will thus be seen that I am retrograding a little,
    to see all that is to be seen in this singular country.</p>

  <p>I have been residing here some weeks, and am able already to say of
    these people as follows:—</p>

  <p>The Minatarees (people of the willows) are a small tribe of about 1500
    souls, residing in three villages of earth-covered lodges, on the
    banks of Knife river; a small stream, so called, meandering through
    a beautiful and extensive prairie, and uniting its waters with the
    Missouri.</p>

  <p>This small community is undoubtedly a part of the tribe of Crows, of
    whom I have already spoken, living at the base of the Rocky Mountains,
    who have at some remote period, either in their war or hunting
    excursions, been run off by their enemy, and their retreat having been
    prevented, have thrown themselves upon the hospitality of the Mandans,
    to whom they have looked for protection, and under whose wing they are
    now living in a sort of confederacy, ready to intermarry and also to
    join, as they often have done, in the common defence of their country.</p>

  <p>In language and personal appearance, as well as in many of their
    customs, they are types of the Crows; yet having adopted and so long
    lived under its influence, the system of the Mandans, they are much
    like them in many respects, and continually assimilating to the modes
    of their patrons and protectors. Amongst their vague and various
    traditions they have evidently some disjointed authority for the manner
    in which they came here; but no account of the time. They say, that
    they came poor—without wigwams or horses—were nearly all women, as
    their warriors had been killed off in their flight; that the Mandans
    would not take them into their village, nor let them come nearer than
    where they are now living, and there assisted them to build their
    villages. From these circumstances their wigwams have been constructed
    exactly in the same manner as those of the Mandans, which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span> have
    already described, and entirely distinct from any custom to be seen in
    the Crow tribe.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the long familiarity in which they have lived with the
    Mandans, and the complete adoption of most of their customs, yet it is
    almost an unaccountable fact, that there is scarcely a man in the tribe
    who can speak half a dozen words of the Mandan language; although on
    the other hand, the Mandans are most of them able to converse in the
    Minataree tongue; leaving us to conclude, either that the Minatarees
    are a very inert and stupid people, or that the Mandan language (which
    is most probably the case) being different from any other language in
    the country, is an exceedingly difficult one to learn.</p>

  <p>The principal village of the Minatarees which is built upon the bank
    of the Knife river (<a href="#i_070"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 70</a>), contains forty or fifty
    earth-covered wigwams, from forty to fifty feet in diameter, and being
    elevated, overlooks the other two which are on lower ground and almost
    lost amidst their numerous corn fields and other profuse vegetation
    which cover the earth with their luxuriant growth.</p>

  <p>The scenery along the banks of this little river, from village to
    village, is quite peculiar and curious; rendered extremely so by the
    continual wild and garrulous groups of men, women, and children, who
    are wending their way along its winding shores, or dashing and plunging
    through its blue waves, enjoying the luxury of swimming, of which
    both sexes seem to be passionately fond. Others are paddling about in
    their tub-like canoes, made of the skins of buffaloes; and every now
    and then, are to be seen their sudatories, or vapour-baths (<a href="#i_071"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    71</a>), where steam is raised by throwing water on to heated stones;
    and the patient jumps from his sweating-house and leaps into the river
    in the highest state of perspiration, as I have more fully described
    whilst speaking of the bathing of the Mandans.</p>

  <p>The chief sachem of this tribe is a very ancient and patriarchal
    looking man, by the name of Eeh-tohk-pah-shee-pee-shah (the black
    moccasin), and counts, undoubtedly, more than an hundred <em>snows</em>.
    I have been for some days an inmate of his hospitable lodge, where he
    sits tottering with age, and silently reigns sole monarch of his little
    community around him, who are continually dropping in to cheer his
    sinking energies, and render him their homage. His voice and his sight
    are nearly gone; but the gestures of his hands are yet energetic and
    youthful, and freely speak the language of his kind heart.</p>

  <p>I have been treated in the kindest manner by this old chief; and have
    painted his portrait (<a href="#i_072"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 72</a>) as he was seated on the floor
    of his wigwam, smoking his pipe, whilst he was recounting over to me
    some of the extraordinary feats of his life, with a beautiful Crow robe
    wrapped around him, and his hair wound up in a conical form upon his
    head, and fastened with a small wooden pin, to keep it in its place.</p>

  <p>This man has many distinct recollections of Lewis and Clarke, who were
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>the first explorers of this country, and who crossed the Rocky
    Mountains thirty years ago. It will be seen by reference to their very
    interesting history of their tour, that they were treated with great
    kindness by this man; and that they in consequence constituted him
    chief of the tribe, with the consent of his people; and he has remained
    their chief ever since. He enquired very earnestly for “Red Hair” and
    “Long Knife” (as he had ever since termed Lewis and Clarke), from the
    fact, that one had red hair (an unexampled thing in his country), and
    the other wore a broad sword which gained for him the appellation of
    “Long Knife.”</p>

  <p>I have told him that “Long Knife” has been many years dead; and that
    “Red Hair” is yet living in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, and no doubt, would be glad to
    hear of him; at which he seemed much pleased, and has signified to me
    that he will make me bearer of some peculiar dispatches to him.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

  <p>The name by which these people are generally called (Grosventres) is
    one given them by the French Traders, and has probably been applied to
    them with some degree of propriety or fitness, as contradistinguished
    from the Mandans, amongst whom these Traders were living; and who
    are a small race of Indians, being generally at or below the average
    stature of man; whilst the Minatarees are generally tall and heavily
    built. There is no tribe in the western wilds, perhaps, who are better
    entitled to the style of warlike, than the Minatarees; for they, unlike
    the Mandans, are continually carrying war into their enemies’ country;
    oftentimes drawing the poor Mandans into unnecessary broils, and
    suffering so much themselves in their desperate war-excursions, that I
    find the proportion of women to the number of men as two or three to
    one, through the tribe.</p>

  <p>The son of Black Moccasin, whose name is Ee-a-chin-che-a (the red
    thunder), and who is reputed one of the most desperate warriors of his
    tribe, I have also painted at full length, in his war-dress (<a href="#i_073"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    73</a>), with his bow in his hand, his quiver slung, and his shield
    upon his arm. In this plight, <i>sans</i> head-dress, <i>sans</i> robe,
    and <i>sans</i> everything that might be an useless incumbrance—with
    the body chiefly naked, and profusely bedaubed with red and black
    paint, so as to form an almost perfect disguise, the Indian warriors
    invariably sally forth to war; save the chief, who always plumes
    himself, and leads on his little band, tendering himself to his enemies
    a conspicuous mark, with all his ornaments and trophies upon him; that
    his enemies, if they get him, may get a prize worth the fighting for.</p>

  <p>Besides chiefs and warriors to be admired in this little tribe, there
    are many beautiful and voluptuous looking women, who are continually
    crowding in throngs, and gazing upon a stranger; and possibly shedding
    more bewitching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span> smiles from a sort of necessity, growing out of the
    great disparity in numbers between them and the rougher sex, to which I
    have before alluded.</p>

  <p>From the very numerous groups of these that have from day to day
    constantly pressed upon me, overlooking the operations of my brush;
    I have been unable to get more than one who would consent to have
    her portrait painted, owing to some fear or dread of harm that might
    eventually ensue in consequence; or from a natural coyness or timidity,
    which is surpassing all description amongst these wild tribes, when in
    presence of strangers.</p>

  <p>The one whom I have painted (<a href="#i_074"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 74</a>) is a descendant from
    the old chief; and though not the most beautiful, is yet a fair sample
    of them, and dressed in a beautiful costume of the mountain-sheep skin,
    handsomely garnished with porcupine quills and beads. This girl was
    almost <em>compelled</em> to stand for her picture by her relatives who
    urged her on, whilst she modestly declined, offering as her excuse that
    “she was not pretty enough, and that her picture would be laughed at.”
    This was either ignorance or excessive art on her part; for she was
    certainly more than comely, and the beauty of her name, Seet-se-be-a
    (the midday sun) is quite enough to make up for a deficiency, if there
    were any, in the beauty of her face.</p>

  <p>I mentioned that I found these people raising abundance of corn or
    maize; and I have happened to visit them in the season of their
    festivities, which annually take place when the ears of corn are of the
    proper size for eating. The green corn is considered a great luxury by
    all those tribes who cultivate it; and is ready for eating as soon as
    the ear is of full size, and the kernels are expanded to their full
    growth, but are yet soft and pulpy. In this green state of the corn,
    it is boiled and dealt out in great profusion to the whole tribe, who
    feast and surfeit upon it whilst it lasts; rendering thanks to the
    <em>Great Spirit</em> for the return of this joyful season, which they do
    by making sacrifices, by dancing, and singing songs or thanksgiving.
    This joyful occasion is one valued alike, and conducted in a similar
    manner, by most of the tribes who raise the corn, however remote they
    may be from each other. It lasts but for a week or ten days; being
    limited to the longest term that the corn remains in this tender and
    palatable state; during which time all hunting, and all war-excursions,
    and all other avocations, are positively dispensed with; and all join
    in the most excessive indulgence of gluttony and conviviality that can
    possibly be conceived. The fields of corn are generally pretty well
    stripped during this excess; and the poor improvident Indian thanks the
    Great Spirit for the indulgence he has had, and is satisfied to ripen
    merely the few ears that are necessary for his next year’s planting,
    without reproaching himself for his wanton lavishness, which has laid
    waste his fine fields, and robbed him of the golden harvest, which
    might have gladdened his heart, with those of his wife and little
    children, through the cold and dreariness of winter.</p>

  <p>The most remarkable feature of these joyous occasion is the <em>green
    corn-dance</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>, which is always given as preparatory to the feast,
    and by most of the tribes in the following manner:—</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>50</i></div>
  <figure id="i_075">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_075.jpg" alt="" />
     <figcaption>75</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>At the usual season, and the time when from outward appearance of the
    stalks and ears of the corn, it is supposed to be nearly ready for
    use, several of the old women who are the owners of fields or patches
    of corn (for such are the proprietors and cultivators of all crops in
    Indian countries, the men never turning their hands to such degrading
    occupations) are delegated by the medicine-men to look at the corn
    fields every morning at sun-rise, and bring into the council-house,
    where the kettle is ready, several ears of corn, the husks of which the
    women are not allowed to break open or even to peep through. The women
    then are from day to day discharged and the doctors left to decide,
    until from repeated examinations they come to the decision that it will
    do; when they dispatch <em>runners</em> or <em>criers</em>, announcing to
    every part of the village or tribe that the Great Spirit has been kind
    to them, and they must all meet on the next day to return thanks for
    his goodness. That all must empty their stomachs, and prepare for the
    feast that is approaching.</p>

  <p>On the day appointed by the doctors, the villagers are all assembled,
    and in the midst of the group a kettle is hung over a fire and filled
    with the green corn, which is well boiled, to be given to the Great
    Spirit, as a sacrifice necessary to be made before any one can indulge
    the cravings of his appetite. Whilst this first kettleful is boiling,
    four medicine-men, with a stalk of the corn in one hand and a rattle
    (she-she-quoi) in the other, with their bodies painted with white clay,
    dance around the kettle, chanting a song of thanksgiving to the Great
    Spirit to whom the offering is to be made (<a href="#i_075"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 75</a>). At the
    same time a number of warriors are dancing around in a more extended
    circle, with stalks of the corn in their hands, and joining also in
    the song of thanksgiving, whilst the villagers are all assembled and
    looking on. During this scene there is an arrangement of wooden bowls
    laid upon the ground, in which the feast is to be dealt out, each one
    having in it a spoon made of the buffalo or mountain-sheep’s horn.</p>

  <p>In this wise the dance continues until the doctors decide that the corn
    is sufficiently boiled; it then stops for a few moments, and again
    assumes a different form and a different song, whilst the doctors are
    placing the ears on a little scaffold of sticks, which they erect
    immediately over the fire where it is entirely consumed, as they join
    again in the dance around it.</p>

  <p>The fire is then removed, and with it the ashes, which together are
    buried in the ground, and <em>new fire</em> is originated on the same
    spot where the old one was, by friction, which is done by a desperate
    and painful exertion by three men seated on the ground, facing each
    other and violently drilling the end of a stick into a hard block of
    wood by rolling it between the hands, each one catching it in turn
    from the others without allowing the motion to stop until smoke, and
    at last a spark of fire is seen and caught in a piece of spunk, when
    there is great rejoicing in the crowd. With this a fire is kindled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
    and the kettleful of corn again boiled for the feast, at which the
    chiefs, doctors, and warriors are seated; and after this an unlimited
    licence is given to the whole tribe, who surfeit upon it and indulge in
    all their favourite amusements and excesses, until the fields of corn
    are exhausted, or its ears have become too hard for their comfortable
    mastication.</p>

  <p>Such are the general features of the green corn festivity and dance
    amongst most of the tribes; and amongst some there are many additional
    forms and ceremonies gone through, preparatory to the indulgence in the
    feast.</p>

  <p>Some of the southern tribes concoct a most bitter and nauseating
    draught, which they call <em>asceola</em> (the black drink), which they
    drink to excess for several days previous to the feast; ejecting
    everything from their stomachs and intestines, enabling them after this
    excessive and painful purgation, to commence with the green corn upon
    an empty and keen stomach.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MINATAREE VILLAGE, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Epistles</span> from such a strange place as this, where I have no desk to
    write from, or mail to send them by, are hastily scribbled off in my
    note-book, as I can steal a little time from the gaze of the wild group
    that is continually about me; and instead of <em>sending</em> them,
    <em>keeping</em> them to bring with me when I make my retreat from the
    country.</p>

  <p>The only place where I can satisfactorily make these entries is in
    the shade of some sequestered tree, to which I occasionally resort,
    or more often from my bed (from which I am now writing), enclosed by
    a sort of curtains made of the skins of elks or buffaloes, completely
    encompassing me, where I am reclining on a sacking-bottom, made of the
    buffalo’s hide; making my entries and notes of the incidents of the
    past day, amidst the roar and unintelligible din of savage conviviality
    that is going on under the same roof, and under my own eye, whenever I
    feel disposed to apply it to a small aperture which brings at once the
    whole interior and all its inmates within my view.</p>

  <p>There are at this time some distinguished guests, besides
    <em>myself</em>, in the lodge of the Black Moccasin; two chiefs or
    leaders of a party of Crows, who arrived here a few days since, on a
    visit to their ancient friends and relatives. The consequence has been,
    that feasting and carousing have been the “order of the day” here for
    some time; and I have luckily been a welcome participator in their
    entertainments. A distinguished chief of the Minatarees, with several
    others in company, has been for some months past on a visit to the
    Crows and returned, attended by some remarkably fine-looking fellows,
    all mounted on fine horses. I have said something of these fine
    specimens of the human race heretofore; and as I have been fastening
    more of them to the canvass within the few days past, I must use this
    occasion to add what follows:—</p>

  <p>I think I have said that no part of the human race could present a
    more picturesque and thrilling appearance on horseback than a party
    of Crows rigged out in all their plumes and trappings—galloping about
    and yelping, in what they call a war-parade, <i>i. e.</i> in a sort of
    tournament or sham-fight, passing rapidly through the evolutions of
    battle, and vaunting forth the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span> wonderful character of their military
    exploits. This is an amusement, of which they are excessively fond; and
    great preparations are invariably made for these occasional shows.</p>

  <p>No tribe of Indians on the Continent are better able to produce a
    pleasing and thrilling effect in these scenes, nor any more vain,
    and consequently better prepared to draw pleasure and satisfaction
    from them, than the Crows. They may be justly said to be the most
    beautifully clad of all the Indians in these regions, and bringing
    from the base of the Rocky Mountains a fine and spirited breed of the
    wild horses, have been able to create a great sensation amongst the
    Minatarees, who have been paying them all attention and all honours for
    some days past.</p>

  <p>From amongst these showy fellows who have been entertaining us and
    pleasing themselves with their extraordinary feats of horsemanship,
    I have selected one of the most conspicuous, and transferred him and
    his horse, with arms and trappings, as faithfully as I could to the
    canvass, for the information of the world, who will learn vastly
    more from lines and colours than they could from oral or written
    delineations.</p>

  <p>I have painted him as he sat for me, balanced on his leaping wild horse
    (<a href="#i_076"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 76</a>) with his shield and quiver slung on his back,
    and his long lance decorated with the eagle’s quills, trailed in his
    right hand. His shirt and his leggings, and moccasins, were of the
    mountain-goat skins, beautifully dressed; and their seams everywhere
    fringed with a profusion of scalp-locks taken from the heads of his
    enemies slain in battle. His long hair, which reached almost to the
    ground whilst he was standing on his feet, was now lifted in the air,
    and floating in black waves over the hips of his leaping charger. On
    his head, and over his shining black locks, he wore a magnificent crest
    or head-dress, made of the quills of the war-eagle and ermine skins;
    and on his horse’s head also was another of equal beauty and precisely
    the same in pattern and material. Added to these ornaments there were
    yet many others which contributed to his picturesque appearance, and
    amongst them a beautiful netting of various colours, that completely
    covered and almost obscured the horse’s head and neck, and extended
    over its back and its hips, terminating in a most extravagant and
    magnificent crupper, embossed and fringed with rows of beautiful shells
    and porcupine quills of various colours.</p>

  <p>With all these picturesque ornaments and trappings upon and about him,
    with a noble figure, and the bold stamp of a wild <em>gentleman</em>
    on his face, added to the rage and spirit of his wild horse, in time
    with whose leaps he issued his startling (though smothered) yelps, as
    he gracefully leaned to and fro, leaving his plumes and his plumage,
    his long locks and his fringes, to float in the wind, he galloped
    about; and felt exceeding pleasure in displaying the extraordinary
    skill which a lifetime of practice and experiment had furnished him
    in the beautiful art of riding and managing his horse, as well as in
    displaying to advantage his weapons and ornaments of dress, by giving
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>them the grace of motion, as they were brandished in the air and
    floating in the wind.</p>

  <p>I have also secured the portraits of Ee-he-a-duck-chee-a (he who ties
    his hair before, <a href="#i_078"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 78</a>), and Pa-ris-ka-roo-pa (the two
    Crows, <a href="#i_077"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 77</a>); fine and fair specimens of this tribe, in
    both of which are exhibited the extraordinary instances of the natural
    hair reaching to the ground, peculiarities belonging almost exclusively
    to this tribe, and of which I have in a former Letter given some
    account. In presenting such instances as these, I offer them, (and the
    reader will take them of course) as extraordinary and rare occurrences
    amongst the tribe, who generally fall short of these in this
    peculiarity, and also in elegance of dress and ornament; although many
    others from their numbers might be selected of equal extravagance. The
    Crows are generally handsome, and comfortably clad; every man in the
    nation oils his hair with a profusion of bear’s grease, and promotes
    its growth to the utmost of his ability; and the greater part of them
    cultivate it down on to the calf of the leg, whilst a few are able to
    make it sweep the ground.</p>

  <p>In a former Letter I gave some account of the form of the head peculiar
    to this tribe which may well be recorded as a national characteristic,
    and worthy of further attention, which I shall give it on a future
    occasion. This striking peculiarity is quite conspicuous in the two
    portraits of which I have just spoken, exhibiting fairly, as they
    are both in profile, the <em>semi-lunar</em> outline of the face of
    which I have before spoken, and which strongly characterizes them
    as distinct from any relationship or resemblance to, the Blackfeet,
    Shiennes, Knisteneaux, Mandans, or other tribes now existing in these
    regions. The peculiar character of which I am speaking, like all other
    national characteristics, is of course met by many exceptions in the
    tribe, though the greater part of the men are thus strongly marked
    with a bold and prominent anti-angular nose, with a clear and rounded
    arch, and a low and receding forehead; the frontal bone oftentimes
    appearing to have been compressed by some effort of art, in a certain
    degree approaching to the horrid distortion thus produced amongst the
    Flatheads beyond the Rocky Mountains. I learned however from repeated
    inquiries, that no such custom is practiced amongst them, but their
    heads, such as they are, are the results of a natural growth, and
    therefore may well be offered as the basis of a national or tribal
    <em>character</em>.</p>

  <p>I recollect to have seen in several publications on the antiquities of
    Mexico, many rude drawings made by the ancient Mexicans, of which the
    singular profiles of these people forcibly remind me, almost bringing
    me to the conclusion that these people may be the descendants of the
    race who have bequeathed those curious and inexplicable remains to the
    world, and whose scattered remnants, from dire and unknown necessities
    of those dark and veiled ages that have gone by, have been jostled and
    thrown along through the hideous and almost impenetrable labyrinths of
    the Rocky Mountains to the place of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span> destination where they now
    live. I am stopped, however, from advancing such as a <em>theory</em>,
    and much prefer to leave it to other hands, who may more easily get
    over difficulties which I should be afraid to encounter in the very
    outset, from the very important questions raised in my mind, as to the
    correctness of those rude and ignorant outlines, in truly establishing
    the looks and character of a people. Amongst a people so ignorant and
    so little advanced in the arts as the ancient Mexicans were, from whose
    tracings those very numerous drawings are copied, I think it would be
    assuming a great deal too much for satisfactory argument, to claim
    that such records were to set up to the world the looks and character
    of a people who have sunk into oblivion, when the heads of horses and
    other animals, drawn by the same hands, are so rude and so much out of
    drawing as scarcely to be distinguished, one from the other. I feel
    as if such rude outlines should be received with great caution and
    distrust, in establishing the character of a people; and for a fair
    illustration of the objection I am raising, I would refer the reader
    to a number of <em>fac-simile</em> drawings which I have copied from
    some of the paintings of the Mandans (on the three plates following
    <a href="#i_065"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 65</a>), where most of the figures have the forehead and
    nose answering exactly to these Mexican outlines, and strikingly
    resembling the <em>living Crows</em>, also, when they have certainly
    borrowed nothing from either, nor have they any living outlines like
    them in their own tribe to have copied from.</p>

  <p>Since writing the above I have passed through many vicissitudes, and
    witnessed many curious scenes worthy of relating, some of which I will
    scribble now, and leave the rest for a more leisure occasion. I have
    witnessed many of the valued games and amusements of this tribe, and
    made sketches of them; and also have painted a number of portraits of
    distinguished warriors and braves which will be found in my collection.</p>

  <p>I have just been exceedingly amused with a formal and grave meeting
    which was called around me, formed by a number of young men, and even
    chiefs and doctors of the tribe, who, having heard that I was <em>great
    medicine</em>, and a great chief, took it upon themselves to suppose
    that I might (or perhaps must) be, a man of influence amongst the “pale
    faces,” and capable of rendering them some relief in a case of very
    great grievance, under which they represented that they were suffering.
    Several most profound speeches were made to me, setting forth these
    grievances, somewhat in the following manner:—They represented, that
    about five or six years ago, an unknown, small animal—not far differing
    in size from a ground squirrel, but with a long, round tail, shewed
    himself slily about one of the chief’s wigwams, peeping out from under
    the pots and kettles, and other such things; which they looked upon as
    great <em>medicine</em>—and no one dared to kill it; but hundreds came to
    watch and look at it. On one of these occasions, one of the spectators
    saw this strange animal catching and devouring a small “deer mouse,”
    of which little and very destructive animals their lodges contained
    many. It was then at once determined that this had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span> been an act of the
    Great Spirit, as a means of putting a stop to the spoliations committed
    by these little sappers, who were cutting their clothing, and other
    manufactures to pieces in a lamentable manner. Councils had been called
    and solemn decrees issued for the countenance and protection of this
    welcome visitor and its progeny, which were soon ascertained to be
    rapidly increasing, and calculated soon to rid them of these thousands
    of little depredators. It was soon, however, learned from one of the
    Fur Traders, that this distinguished object of their superstition
    (which my man Ba’tiste familiarly calls “<em>Monsr. Ratapon</em>”) had, a
    short time before, landed himself from one of their keel boats, which
    had ascended the Missouri river for the distance of 1800 miles; and had
    taken up its residence, without introduction or invitation, in one of
    their earth-covered wigwams.</p>

  <p>This information, for a while, curtailed the extraordinary respect they
    had for some time been paying to it; but its continual war upon these
    little mice, which it was using for its food, in the absence of all
    other nutriment, continued to command their respect, in spite of the
    manner in which it had been introduced; being unwilling to believe that
    it had come from that source, even, without the agency in some way of
    the Great Spirit.</p>

  <p>Having been thus introduced and nurtured, and their numbers having
    been so wonderfully increased in the few last years, that every wigwam
    was infested with them,—that their <i lang="fr">caches</i>, where they bury
    their corn and other provisions, were robbed and sacked; and the very
    pavements under their wigwams were so vaulted and sapped, that they
    were actually falling to the ground; they were now looked upon as a
    most disastrous nuisance, and a public calamity, to which it was the
    object of this meeting to call my attention, evidently in hopes that
    I might be able to designate some successful mode of relieving them
    from this real misfortune. I got rid of them at last, by assuring them
    of my deep regret for their situation, which was, to be sure, a very
    unpleasant one; and told them, that there was really a great deal of
    <em>medicine</em> in the thing, and that I should therefore be quite
    unwilling to have anything to do with it. Ba’tiste and Bogard, who are
    yet my daily and almost hourly companions, took to themselves a great
    deal of fun and amusement at the end of this interview, by suggesting
    many remedies for the evil, and enjoying many hearty laughs; after
    which, Ba’tiste, Bogard and I, took our hats; and I took my sketch-book
    in hand, and we started on a visit to the upper town of the Minatarees,
    which is half a mile or more distant, and on the other bank of the
    Knife River, which we crossed in the following manner:—The old chief,
    having learned that we were to cross the river, gave direction to
    one of the women of his numerous household, who took upon her head
    a skin-canoe (more familiarly called in this country, a bull-boat),
    made in the form of a large tub, of a buffalo’s skin, stretched on a
    frame of willow boughs, which she carried to the water’s edge; and
    placing it in the water, made signs for us three to get into it. When
    we were in, and seated flat on its bottom, with scarce room in any
    way to adjust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span> our legs and our feet (as we sat necessarily facing
    each other), she stepped before the boat, and pulling it along, waded
    towards the deeper water, with her back towards us, carefully with the
    other hand attending to her dress, which seemed to be but a light slip,
    and floating upon the surface until the water was above her waist, when
    it was instantly turned off, over her head, and thrown ashore; and she
    boldly plunged forward, swimming and drawing the boat with one hand,
    which she did with apparent ease. In this manner we were conveyed to
    the middle of the stream, where we were soon surrounded by a dozen or
    more beautiful girls, from twelve to fifteen and eighteen years of age,
    who were at that time bathing on the opposite shore.</p>

  <p>They all swam in a bold and graceful manner, and as confidently as so
    many otters or beavers; and gathering around us, with their long black
    hair floating about on the water, whilst their faces were glowing with
    jokes and fun, which they were cracking about us, and which we could
    not understand.</p>

  <p>In the midst of this delightful little aquatic group, we three sat in
    our little skin-bound tub (like the “three wise men of Gotham, who
    went to sea in a bowl,” &amp;c.), floating along down the current, losing
    sight, and all thoughts, of the shore, which was equi-distant from us
    on either side; whilst we were amusing ourselves with the playfulness
    of these dear little creatures who were floating about under the
    clear blue water, catching their hands on to the sides of our boat;
    occasionally raising one-half of their bodies out of the water, and
    sinking again, like so many mermaids.</p>

  <p>In the midst of this bewildering and tantalizing entertainment, in
    which poor Ba’tiste and Bogard, as well as myself, were all taking
    infinite pleasure, and which we supposed was all intended for our
    especial amusement; we found ourselves suddenly in the delightful
    dilemma of floating down the current in the middle of the river; and
    of being turned round and round to the excessive amusement of the
    villagers, who were laughing at us from the shore, as well as these
    little tyros, whose delicate hands were besetting our tub on all
    sides; and for an escape from whom, or for fending off, we had neither
    an oar, or anything else, that we could wield in self-defence, or
    for self-preservation. In this awkward predicament, our feelings of
    excessive admiration were immediately changed, to those of exceeding
    vexation, as we now learned that they had peremptorily discharged
    from her occupation our fair conductress, who had undertaken to ferry
    us safely across the river; and had also very ingeniously laid their
    plans, of which we had been ignorant until the present moment, to
    extort from us in this way, some little evidences of our liberality,
    which, in fact, it was impossible to refuse them, after so liberal and
    bewitching an exhibition on their part, as well as from the imperative
    obligation which the awkwardness of our situation had laid us under. I
    had some awls in my pockets, which I presented to them, and also a few
    strings of beautiful beads, which I placed over their delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span> necks
    as they raised them out of the water by the side of our boat; after
    which they all joined in conducting our craft to the shore, by swimming
    by the sides of, and behind it, pushing it along in the direction where
    they designed to land it, until the water became so shallow, that their
    feet were upon the bottom, when they waded along with great coyness,
    dragging us towards the shore, as long as their bodies, in a crouching
    position, could possibly be half concealed under the water, when they
    gave our boat the last push for the shore, and raising a loud and
    exulting laugh, plunged back again into the river; leaving us the only
    alternative of sitting still where we were, or of stepping out into
    the water at half leg deep, and of wading to the shore, which we at
    once did, and soon escaped from the view of our little tormentors, and
    the numerous lookers-on, on our way to the upper village, which I have
    before mentioned.</p>

  <p>Here I was very politely treated by the <em>Yellow Moccasin</em>,
    quite an old man, and who seemed to be chief of this band or family,
    constituting their little community of thirty or forty lodges,
    averaging, perhaps, twenty persons to each. I was feasted in this man’s
    lodge—and afterwards invited to accompany him and several others to
    a beautiful prairie, a mile or so above the village, where the young
    men and young women of this town, and many from the village below, had
    assembled for their amusements; the chief of which seemed to be that
    of racing their horses. In the midst of these scenes, after I had been
    for some time a looker-on, and had felt some considerable degree of
    sympathy for a fine-looking young fellow, whose horse had been twice
    beaten on the course, and whose losses had been considerable; for
    which, his sister, a very modest and pretty girl, was most piteously
    howling and crying. I selected and brought forward an ordinary-looking
    pony, that was evidently too fat and too sleek to run against his
    fine-limbed little horse that had disappointed his high hopes; and I
    began to comment extravagantly upon its muscle, &amp;c., when I discovered
    him evidently cheering up with the hope of getting me and my pony on
    to the turf with him; for which he soon made me a proposition; and
    I, having lauded the limbs of my little nag too much to “back out,”
    agreed to run a short race with him of half a mile, for three yards
    of scarlet cloth, a knife, and half a dozen strings of beads, which I
    was willing to stake against a handsome pair of leggings, which he was
    wearing at the time. The greatest imaginable excitement was now raised
    amongst the crowd by this arrangement; to see a white man preparing to
    run with an Indian jockey, and that with a scrub of a pony, in whose
    powers of running no Indian had the least confidence. Yet, there was no
    one in the crowd, who dared to take up the several other little bets I
    was willing to tender (merely for their amusement, and for their final
    exultation); owing, undoubtedly, to the bold and confident manner in
    which I had ventured on the merits of this little horse, which the
    tribe had all overlooked; and needs must have some <em>medicine</em>
    about it.</p>

  <p>So far was this panic carried, that even my champion was ready to
    withdraw;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span> but his friends encouraged him at length, and we galloped
    our horses off to the other end of the course, where we were to start;
    and where we were accompanied by a number of horsemen, who were to
    witness the “set off.” Some considerable delay here took place, from
    a <em>condition</em>, which was then named to me, and which I had not
    observed before, that in all the races of this day, every rider was to
    run entirely denuded, and ride a naked horse! Here I was completely
    balked, and having no one by me to interpret a word, I was quite at a
    loss to decide what was best to do. I found however, that remonstrance
    was of little avail; and as I had volunteered in this thing to gratify
    and flatter them, I thought it best not positively to displease them
    in this; so I laid off my clothes, and straddled the naked back of my
    round and glossy little pony, by the side of my competitor, who was
    also mounted and stripped to the skin, and panting with a restless
    anxiety for the start.</p>

  <p>Reader! did you ever imagine that in the <em>middle of a man’s life</em>
    there could be a thought or a feeling so <em>new</em> to him, as to throw
    him instantly back to infancy; with a new world and a new genius before
    him—started afresh, to navigate and breathe the elements of naked and
    untasted liberty, which clothe him in their cool and silken robes that
    float about him; and wafting their life-inspiring folds to his inmost
    lungs? If you never have been inspired with such a feeling, and have
    been in the habit of believing that you have thought of, and imagined a
    little of every thing, try for a moment, to disrobe your mind and your
    body, and help me through feelings to which I cannot give utterance.
    Imagine yourselves as I was, with my trembling little horse underneath
    me, and the cool atmosphere that was floating about, and ready, more
    closely and familiarly to embrace me, as it did, at the next moment,
    when we “were off,” and struggling for the goal and the prize.</p>

  <p>Though my little Pegasus seemed to dart through the clouds, and I to
    be wafted on the wings of Mercury, yet my red adversary was leaving
    me too far behind for further competition; and I wheeled to the left,
    making a circuit on the prairie, and came in at the starting point,
    much to the satisfaction and exultation of the jockeys; but greatly
    to the murmuring disappointment of the women and children, who had
    assembled in a dense throng to witness the “coming out” of the “white
    medicine-man.” I clothed myself instantly, and came back, acknowledging
    my defeat, and the superior skill of my competitor, as well as the
    wonderful muscle of his little charger, which pleased him much; and
    his sisters’ lamentations were soon turned to joy, by the receipt of a
    beautiful scarlet robe, and a profusion of vari-coloured beads, which
    were speedily paraded on her copper-coloured neck.</p>

  <p>After I had seen enough of these amusements, I succeeded with some
    difficulty, in pulling Ba’tiste and Bogard from amongst the groups of
    women and girls, where they seemed to be successfully ingratiating
    themselves; and we trudged back to the little village of earth-covered
    lodges, which were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span> hemmed in, and almost obscured from the eye, by
    the fields of corn and luxuriant growth of wild sun-flowers, and other
    vegetable productions of the soil, whose spontaneous growth had reared
    their heads in such profusion, as to appear all but like a dense and
    formidable forest.</p>

  <p>We loitered about this little village awhile, looking into most of its
    lodges, and tracing its winding avenues, after which we recrossed the
    river and wended our way back again to head-quarters, from whence we
    started in the morning, and where I am now writing. This day’s ramble
    shewed to us all the inhabitants of this little tribe, except a portion
    of their warriors who are out on a war excursion against the Riccarees;
    and I have been exceedingly pleased with their general behaviour and
    looks, as well as with their numerous games and amusements, in many of
    which I have given them great pleasure by taking a part.</p>

  <p>The Minatarees, as I have before said, are a bold, daring, and warlike
    tribe; quite different in these respects from their neighbours the
    Mandans, carrying war continually in their enemies’ country, thereby
    exposing their lives and diminishing the number of their warriors
    to that degree that I find two or three women to a man, through the
    tribe. They are bold and fearless in the chase also, and in their eager
    pursuits of the bison, or buffaloes, their feats are such as to excite
    the astonishment and admiration of all who behold them. Of these scenes
    I have witnessed many since I came into this country, and amongst
    them all, nothing have I seen to compare with one to which I was an
    eye-witness a few mornings since, and well worthy of being described.</p>

  <p>The Minatarees, as well as the Mandans, had suffered for some months
    past for want of meat, and had indulged in the most alarming fears,
    that the herds of buffaloes were emigrating so far off from them,
    that there was great danger of their actual starvation, when it was
    suddenly announced through the village one morning at an early hour,
    that a herd of buffaloes was in sight, when an hundred or more young
    men mounted their horses with weapons in hand and steered their course
    to the prairies. The chief informed me that one of his horses was in
    readiness for me at the door of his wigwam, and that I had better go
    and see the curious affair. I accepted his polite offer, and mounting
    the steed, galloped off with the hunters to the prairies, where we
    soon descried at a distance, a fine herd of buffaloes grazing, when
    a halt and a council were ordered, and the mode of attack was agreed
    upon. I had armed myself with my pencil and my sketch-book only, and
    consequently took my position generally in the rear, where I could see
    and appreciate every manœuvre.</p>

  <p>The plan of attack, which in this country is familiarly called a
    “<em>surround</em>,” was explicitly agreed upon, and the hunters who were
    all mounted on their “buffalo horses” and armed with bows and arrows or
    long lances, divided into two columns, taking opposite directions, and
    drew themselves gradually around the herd at a mile or more distance
    from them; thus forming a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span> circle of horsemen at equal distances
    apart, who gradually closed in upon them with a moderate pace, at a
    signal given. The unsuspecting herd at length “got the wind” of the
    approaching enemy and fled in a mass in the greatest confusion. To
    the point where they were aiming to cross the line, the horsemen were
    seen at full speed, gathering and forming in a column, brandishing
    their weapons and yelling in the most frightful manner, by which means
    they turned the black and rushing mass which moved off in an opposite
    direction where they were again met and foiled in a similar manner,
    and wheeled back in utter confusion; by which time the horsemen had
    closed in from all directions, forming a continuous line around them,
    whilst the poor affrighted animals were eddying about in a crowded and
    confused mass, hooking and climbing upon each ether; when the work of
    death commenced. I had rode up in the rear and occupied an elevated
    position at a few rods distance, from which I could (like the general
    of a battle field) survey from my horse’s back, the nature and the
    progress of the grand mêlée; but (unlike him) without the power of
    issuing a command or in any way directing its issue.</p>

  <p>In this grand turmoil (<a href="#i_079"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 79</a>), a cloud of dust was soon
    raised, which in parts obscured the throng where the hunters were
    galloping their horses around and driving the whizzing arrows or
    their long lances to the hearts of these noble animals; which in many
    instances, becoming infuriated with deadly wounds in their sides,
    erected their shaggy manes over their bloodshot eyes and furiously
    plunged forwards at the sides of their assailants’ horses, sometimes
    goring them to death at a lunge, and putting their dismounted riders to
    flight for their lives; sometimes their dense crowd was opened, and the
    blinded horsemen, too intent on their prey amidst the cloud of dust,
    were hemmed and wedged in amidst the crowding beasts, over whose backs
    they were obliged to leap for security, leaving their horses to the
    fate that might await them in the results of this wild and desperate
    war. Many were the bulls that turned upon their assailants and met
    them with desperate resistance; and many were the warriors who were
    dismounted, and saved themselves by the superior muscles of their legs;
    some who were closely pursued by the bulls, wheeled suddenly around and
    snatching the part of a buffalo robe from around their waists, threw it
    over the horns and the eyes of the infuriated beast, and darting by its
    side drove the arrow or the lance to its heart. Others suddenly dashed
    off upon the prairies by the side of the affrighted animals which had
    escaped from the throng, and closely escorting them for a few rods,
    brought down their hearts blood in streams, and their huge carcasses
    upon the green and enamelled turf.</p>

  <p>In this way this grand hunt soon resolved itself into a desperate
    battle; and in the space of fifteen minutes, resulted in the total
    destruction of the whole herd, which in all their strength and fury
    were doomed, like every beast and living thing else, to fall before the
    destroying hands of mighty man.</p>

  <p>I had sat in trembling silence upon my horse, and witnessed this
    extraordinary scene, which allowed not one of these animals to escape
    out of my sight. Many plunged off upon the prairie for a distance, but
    were overtaken and killed; and although I could not distinctly estimate
    the number that were slain, yet I am sure that some hundreds of these
    noble animals fell in this grand mêlée.</p>

  <p>The scene after the battle was over was novel and curious in the
    extreme; the hunters were moving about amongst the dead and dying
    animals, leading their horses by their halters, and claiming their
    victims by their private marks upon their arrows, which they were
    drawing from the wounds in the animals’ sides.</p>

  <p>Amongst the poor affrighted creatures that had occasionally dashed
    through the ranks of their enemy, and sought safety in flight upon the
    prairie (and in some instances, had undoubtedly gained it), I saw them
    stand awhile, looking back, when they turned, and, as if bent on their
    own destruction, retraced their steps, and mingled themselves and their
    deaths with those of the dying throng. Others had fled to a distance on
    the prairies and for want of company, of friends or of foes, had stood
    and gazed on till the battle-scene was over; seemingly taking pains to
    stay, and hold their lives in readiness for their destroyers, until
    the general destruction was over, when they fell easy victims to their
    weapons—making the slaughter complete.</p>

  <p>After this scene, and after arrows had been claimed and recovered, a
    general council was held, when all hands were seated on the ground, and
    a few pipes smoked; after which, all mounted their horses and rode back
    to the village.</p>

  <p>A deputation of several of the warriors was sent to the chief, who
    explained to him what had been their success; and the same intelligence
    was soon communicated by little squads to every family in the village;
    and preparations were at once made for securing the meat. For this
    purpose, some hundreds of women and children, to whose lots fall all
    the drudgeries of Indian life, started out upon the trail, which
    led them to the battle-field, where they spent the day in skinning
    the animals, and cutting up the meat, which was mostly brought into
    the villages on their backs, as they tugged and sweated under their
    enormous and cruel loads.</p>

  <p>I rode out to see this curious scene; and I regret exceedingly that I
    kept no memorandum of it in my sketch-book. Amidst the throng of women
    and children, that had been assembled, and all of whom seemed busily at
    work, were many superannuated and disabled nags, which they had brought
    out to assist in carrying in the meat; and at least, one thousand
    semi-loup dogs, and whelps, whose keen appetites and sagacity had
    brought them out, to claim their shares of this abundant and sumptuous
    supply.</p>

  <p>I staid and inspected this curious group for an hour or more,
    during which time, I was almost continually amused by the clamorous
    contentions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span> that arose, and generally ended, in desperate combats;
    both amongst the dogs and women, who seemed alike tenacious of their
    local and recently acquired rights; and disposed to settle their claims
    by “tooth and nail”—by manual and brute force.</p>

  <p>When I had seen enough of this I rode to the top of a beautiful prairie
    bluff, a mile or two from the scene, where I was exceedingly amused by
    overlooking the route that laid between this and the village, which
    was over the undulating green fields for several miles, that laid
    beneath me; over which there seemed a continual string of women, dogs
    and horses, for the rest of the day, passing and repassing as they
    were busily bearing home their heavy burthens to their village, and in
    their miniature appearance, which the distance gave them, not unlike
    to a busy community of ants as they are sometimes seen, sacking and
    transporting the treasures of a cupboard, or the sweets of a sugar
    bowl.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">LITTLE MANDAN VILLAGE, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">In</span> speaking of the Mandans, in a former Letter, I mentioned that they
    were living in two villages, which are about two miles apart. Of their
    principal village I have given a minute account, which precludes the
    necessity of my saying much of their smaller town, to which I descended
    a few days since, from the Minatarees; and where I find their modes
    and customs, precisely the same as I have heretofore described. This
    village contains sixty or eighty lodges, built in the same manner as
    those which I have already mentioned, and I have just learned that
    they have been keeping the annual ceremony here, precisely in the same
    manner as that which I witnessed in the lower or larger town, and have
    explained.</p>

  <p>I have been treated with the same hospitality here that was extended
    to me in the other village; and have painted the portraits of several
    distinguished persons, which has astonished and pleased them very much.
    The operation of my brush always gains me many enthusiastic friends
    wherever I go amongst these wild folks; and in this village I have
    been unusually honoured and even <em>afflicted</em>, by the friendly
    importunities of one of these reverencing parasites, who (amongst
    various other offices of hospitality and kindness which he has been
    bent upon extending to me), has insisted on, and for several nights
    been indulged in, the honour as he would term it, of offering his body
    for my pillow, which <em>I</em> have not had the heart to reject, and of
    course <em>he</em> has not lacked the vanity to boast of, as an act of
    signal kindness and hospitality on his part, towards a <em>great</em> and
    <em>a distinguished stranger</em>!</p>

  <p>I have been for several days suffering somewhat with an influenza,
    which has induced me to leave my bed, on the side of the lodge, and
    sleep on the floor, wrapped in a buffalo robe, with my feet to the
    fire in the centre of the room, to which place the genuine politeness
    of my constant and watchful friend has as regularly drawn him, where
    his irresistible importunities have brought me, night after night, to
    the only alternative of using his bedaubed and bear-greased body for a
    pillow.</p>

  <p>Being unwilling to deny the poor fellow the satisfaction he seemed to
    be drawing from this singular freak, I took some pains to inquire into
    his character; and learned that he was a Riccaree brave, by the name of
    Pah-too-ca-ra (he who strikes), who is here with several others of his
    tribe, on a friendly visit (though in a hostile village), and living
    as they are, unprotected,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span> except by the mercy of their enemies. I
    think it probable, therefore, that he is ingeniously endeavouring thus
    to ingratiate himself in my affections, and consequently to insure my
    guardianship and influence for his protection. Be this as it may, he is
    rendering me many kind services, and I have in return traced him on my
    canvass for immortality (<a href="#i_083"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 83</a>).</p>

  <p>By the side of him (<a href="#i_084"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 84</a>), I have painted a beautiful
    little girl of the same tribe, whose name is Pshan-shaw (the
    sweet-scented grass), giving a very pretty specimen of the dress and
    fashion of the women in this tribe. The inner garment, which is like
    a slip or a frock, is entire in one piece, and beautifully ornamented
    with embroidery and beads, with a row of elks’ teeth passing across
    the breast, and a robe of the young buffalo’s skin, tastefully and
    elaborately embroidered, gracefully thrown over her shoulders, and
    hanging down to the ground behind her.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_082"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 82</a> gives a portrait of one of the chiefs of this tribe
    by the name of Stan-au-pat (the bloody hand), and (<a href="#i_081"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 81</a>)
    of Kah-beck-a (the twin), a good-looking matron, who was painted a few
    weeks since in the principal Mandan village.</p>

  <p>The dresses in both of these portraits are very beautiful, and I have
    procured them, as well as the one before spoken of, for my collection.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_080"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 80</a>, gives a view of the Riccaree village, which is
    beautifully situated on the west bank of the river, 200 miles below the
    Mandans; and built very much in the same manner; being constituted of
    150 earth-covered lodges, which are in part surrounded by an imperfect
    and open barrier of piquets set firmly in the ground, and of ten or
    twelve feet in height.</p>

  <p>This village is built upon an open prairie, and the gracefully
    undulating hills that rise in distance behind it are everywhere covered
    with a verdant green turf, without a tree or a bush anywhere to be
    seen. This view was taken from the deck of the steamer when I was on my
    way up the river; and probably it was well that I took it then, for so
    hostile and deadly are the feelings of these people towards the <em>pale
    faces</em>, at this time, that it may be deemed most prudent for me to
    pass them on my way down the river, without stopping to make them a
    visit. They certainly are harbouring the most resentful feelings at
    this time towards the Traders, and others passing on the river; and no
    doubt, that there is great danger of the lives of any white men, who
    unluckily fall into their hands. They have recently sworn death and
    destruction to every white man, who comes in their way; and there is no
    doubt, that they are ready to execute their threats.</p>

  <p>When Lewis and Clarke first visited these people thirty years since,
    it will be found by a reference to their history, that the Riccarees
    received and treated them with great kindness and hospitality; but
    owing to the system of trade, and the manner in which it has been
    conducted in this country, they have been inflicted with real or
    imaginary abuses, of which they are themselves, and the Fur Traders,
    the best judges; and for which they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span> now harbouring the most
    inveterate feelings towards the whole civilized race.</p>

  <p>The Riccarees are unquestionably a part of the tribe of Pawnees, living
    on the Platte River, some hundreds of miles below this, inasmuch
    as their language is nearly or quite the same; and their personal
    appearance and customs as similar as could be reasonably expected
    amongst a people so long since separated from their parent tribe, and
    continually subjected to innovations from the neighbouring tribes
    around them; amongst whom, in their erratic wanderings in search of a
    location, they have been jostled about in the character, alternately,
    of friends and of foes.</p>

  <p>I shall resume my voyage down the river in a few days in my canoe; and
    I may, perhaps, stop and pay these people a visit, and consequently, be
    able to say more of them; or, I may be <em>hauled in</em>, to the shore,
    and my boat plundered, and my “<em>scalp danced</em>,” as they have dealt
    quite recently with the <em>last trader</em>, who has dared for several
    years past, to continue his residence with them, after they had laid
    fatal hands on each one of his comrades before him, and divided and
    shared their goods.</p>

  <p>Of the Mandans, who are about me in this little village, I need say
    nothing, except that they are in every respect, the same as those
    I have described in the lower village—and in fact, I believe this
    little town is rather a <em>summer residence</em> for a few of the noted
    families, than anything else; as I am told that none of their wigwams
    are tenanted through the winter. I shall leave them in the morning,
    and take up my residence a few days longer with my hospitable friends
    Mr. Kipp, Mah-to-toh-pa, &amp;c. in the large village; and then with my
    canvass and easel, and paint-pots in my canoe; with Ba’tiste and Bogard
    to paddle, and my own oar to steer, wend my way again on the mighty
    Missouri towards my native land, bidding everlasting farewell to the
    kind and hospitable Mandans.</p>

  <p>In taking this final leave of them, which will be done with some
    decided feelings of regret, and in receding from their country, I shall
    look back and reflect upon them and their curious and peculiar modes
    with no small degree of pleasure, as well as surprise; inasmuch as
    their hospitality and friendly treatment have fully corroborated my
    fixed belief that the North American Indian in his primitive state is
    a high-minded, hospitable and honourable being—and their singular and
    peculiar customs have raised an irresistible belief in my mind that
    they have had a different origin, or are of a different compound of
    character from any other tribe that I have yet seen, or that can be
    probably seen in North America.</p>

  <p>In coming to such a conclusion as this, the mind is at once filled with
    a flood of enquiries as to the source from which they have sprung,
    and eagerly seeking for the evidence which is to lead it to the most
    probable and correct conclusion. Amongst these evidences of which there
    are many, and forcible ones to be met with amongst these people, and
    many of which I have named in my former epistles, the most striking
    ones are those which go, I think, decidedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span> to suggest the existence
    of looks and of customs amongst them, bearing incontestible proofs of
    an amalgam of civilized and savage; and that in the absence of all
    proof of any recent proximity of a civilized stock that could in any
    way have been engrafted upon them.</p>

  <p>These facts then, with the host of their peculiarities which stare
    a traveller in the face, lead the mind back in search of some more
    remote and rational cause for such striking singularities; and in
    this dilemma, I have been almost disposed (not to advance it as a
    <em>theory</em>, but) to enquire whether here may not be found, yet
    existing, the remains of the <em>Welsh colony</em>—the followers of
    Madoc; who history tells us, if I recollect right, started with ten
    ships, to colonize a country which he had discovered in the Western
    Ocean; whose expedition I think has been pretty clearly traced to the
    mouth of the Mississippi, or the coast of Florida, and whose fate
    further than this seems sealed in unsearchable mystery.</p>

  <p>I am travelling in this country as I have before said, not to advance
    or to prove <em>theories</em>, but to see all that I am able to see,
    and to tell it in the simplest and most intelligible manner I can
    to the world, for their own conclusions, or for theories I may feel
    disposed to advance, and be better able to defend after I get out of
    this singular country; where all the powers of ones faculties are
    required, and much better employed I consider, in helping him along and
    in gathering materials, than in stopping to draw too nice and delicate
    conclusions by the way.</p>

  <p>If my indefinite recollections of the fate of that colony, however,
    as recorded in history be correct, I see no harm in suggesting the
    inquiry, whether they did not sail up the Mississippi river in their
    ten ships, or such number of them as might have arrived safe in its
    mouth; and having advanced up the Ohio from its junction, (as they
    naturally would, it being the widest and most gentle current) to a
    rich and fertile country, planted themselves as agriculturalists
    on its rich banks, where they lived and flourished, and increased
    in numbers, until they were attacked, and at last besieged by the
    numerous hordes of savages who were jealous of their growing condition;
    and as a protection against their assaults, built those numerous
    <em>civilized</em> fortifications, the ruins of which are now to be
    seen on the Ohio and the Muskingum, in which they were at last all
    destroyed, except some few families who had intermarried with the
    Indians, and whose offspring, being half-breeds, were in such a manner
    allied to them that their lives were spared; and forming themselves
    into a small and separate community, took up their residence on the
    banks of the Missouri; on which, for the want of a permanent location,
    being on the lands of their more powerful enemies, were obliged
    repeatedly to remove; and continuing their course up the river, have in
    time migrated to the place where they are now living, and consequently
    found with the numerous and almost unaccountable peculiarities of which
    I have before spoken, so inconsonant with the general character of the
    North American Indians; with complexions of every shade; with hair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span> of
    all the colours in civilized society, and many with hazel, with grey,
    and with blue eyes.</p>

  <p>The above is a suggestion of a <em>moment</em>; and I wish the reader to
    bear it in mind, that if I ever advance such as a <em>theory</em>, it
    will be after I have collected other proofs, which I shall take great
    pains to do; after I have taken a vocabulary of their language, and
    also in my transit down the river in my canoe, I may be able from my
    own examinations of the ground, to ascertain whether the shores of the
    Missouri bear evidences of their former locations; or whether amongst
    the tribes who inhabit the country below, there remain any satisfactory
    traditions of their residences in, and transit through their countries.</p>

  <p>I close here my book (and probably for some time, my remarks), on the
    friendly and hospitable Mandans.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="smcap">Note</span>—Several years having elapsed since the above account

      their country; and the manner and causes of their misfortune

  <div class="subheadc">MOUTH OF TETON RIVER, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Since</span> writing the above Letter I have descended the Missouri, a
    distance of six or seven hundred miles, in my little bark, with
    Ba’tiste and Bogard, my old “<i lang="fr">compagnons du voyage</i>,” and have
    much to say of what we three did and what we saw on our way, which will
    be given anon.</p>

  <p>I am now in the heart of the country belonging to the numerous tribe
    of Sioux or Dohcotas, and have Indian faces and Indian customs in
    abundance around me. This tribe is one of the most numerous in North
    America, and also one of the most vigorous and warlike tribes to be
    found, numbering some forty or fifty thousand, and able undoubtedly
    to muster, if the tribe could be moved simultaneously, at least eight
    or ten thousand warriors, well mounted and well armed. This tribe
    take vast numbers of the wild horses on the plains towards the Rocky
    Mountains, and many of them have been supplied with guns; but the
    greater part of them hunt with their bows and arrows and long lances,
    killing their game from their horses’ backs while at full speed.</p>

  <p>The name Sioux (pronounced <i>see-oo</i>) by which they are familiarly
    called, is one that has been given to them by the French traders, the
    meaning of which I never have learned; their own name being, in their
    language, Dah-co-ta. The personal appearance of these people is very
    fine and prepossessing, their persons tall and straight, and their
    movements elastic and graceful. Their stature is considerably above
    that of the Mandans and Riccarees, or Blackfeet; but about equal to
    that of the Crows, Assinneboins and Minatarees, furnishing at least one
    half of their warriors of six feet or more in height.</p>

  <p>I am here living with, and enjoying the hospitality of a gentleman
    by the name of <i>Laidlaw</i>, a Scotchman, who is attached to the
    American Fur Company, and who, in company with Mr. M‘Kenzie (of whom
    I have before spoken) and Lamont, has the whole agency of the Fur
    Company’s transactions in the regions of the Upper Missouri and the
    Rocky Mountains.</p>

  <p>This gentleman has a finely-built Fort here, of two or three hundred
    feet square, enclosing eight or ten of their factories, houses and
    stores, in the midst of which he occupies spacious and comfortable
    apartments, which are well supplied with the comforts and luxuries of
    life and neatly and respectably conducted by a fine looking, modest,
    and dignified Sioux<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span> woman, the kind and affectionate mother of his
    little flock of pretty and interesting children.</p>

  <figure class="illowp75 mt2" id="i_086">
    <div class="plate"><i>58</i></div>
    <img src="images/i_086.jpg" alt="" />
     <figcaption>86</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>This Fort is undoubtedly one of the most important and productive
    of the American Fur Company’s posts, being in the centre of the
    great Sioux country, drawing from all quarters an immense and almost
    incredible number of buffalo robes, which are carried to the New York
    and other Eastern markets, and sold at a great profit. This post
    is thirteen hundred miles above <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, on the west bank of the
    Missouri, on a beautiful plain near the mouth of the Teton river which
    empties into the Missouri from the West, and the Fort has received
    the name of Fort Pierre, in compliment to Monsr. Pierre Chouteau, who
    is one of the partners in the Fur Company, residing in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis; and
    to whose politeness I am indebted, as I have before mentioned, for my
    passage in the Company’s steamer, on her first voyage to the Yellow
    Stone; and whose urbane and gentlemanly society, I have before said, I
    had during my passage.</p>

  <p>The country about this Fort is almost entirely prairie, producing along
    the banks of the river and streams only, slight skirtings of timber.
    No site could have been selected more pleasing or more advantageous
    than this; the Fort is in the centre of one of the Missouri’s most
    beautiful plains, and hemmed in by a series of gracefully undulating,
    grass-covered hills, on all sides; rising like a series of terraces,
    to the summit level of the prairies, some three or four hundred feet
    in elevation, which then stretches off in an apparently boundless
    ocean of gracefully swelling waves and fields of green. On my way
    up the river I made a painting of this lovely spot, taken from the
    summit of the bluffs, a mile or two distant (<a href="#i_085"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 85</a>),
    shewing an encampment of Sioux, of six hundred tents or skin lodges,
    around the Fort, where they had concentrated to make their spring
    trade; exchanging their furs and peltries for articles and luxuries of
    civilized manufactures.</p>

  <p>The great family of Sioux who occupy so vast a tract of country,
    extending from the banks of the Mississippi river to the base of
    the Rocky Mountains, are everywhere a migratory or roaming tribe,
    divided into forty-two bands or families, each having a chief who
    all acknowledge a superior or head chief, to whom they all are held
    subordinate. This subordination, however, I should rather record as
    their <em>former</em> and <em>native</em> regulation, of which there exists
    no doubt, than an <em>existing</em> one, since the numerous innovations
    made amongst these people by the Fur Traders, as well as by the
    proximity of civilization along a great deal of their frontier, which
    soon upset and change many native regulations, and particularly those
    relating to their government and religion.</p>

  <p>There is one principal and familiar division of this tribe into what
    are called the <em>Mississippi</em> and <em>Missouri</em> Sioux. Those
    bordering on the banks of the Mississippi, concentrating at Prairie du
    Chien and Fort Snelling, for the purposes of trade, &amp;c., are called the
    Mississippi Sioux. These are somewhat advanced towards civilization,
    and familiar with white people, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span> whom they have held intercourse
    for many years, and are consequently excessive whiskey drinkers, though
    constituting but a meagre proportion, and at the same time, but a very
    unfair and imperfect sample of the great mass of this tribe who inhabit
    the shores of the Missouri, and fearlessly roam on the vast plains
    intervening between it and the Rocky Mountains, and are still living
    entirely in their primitive condition.</p>

  <p>There is no tribe on the Continent, perhaps, of finer looking men than
    the Sioux; and few tribes who are better and more comfortably clad, and
    supplied with the necessaries of life. There are no parts of the great
    plains of America which are more abundantly stocked with buffaloes and
    wild horses, nor any people more bold in destroying the one for food,
    and appropriating the other to their use. There has gone abroad, from
    the many histories which have been written of these people, an opinion
    which is too current in the world, that the Indian is necessarily a
    poor, drunken, murderous wretch; which account is certainly unjust
    as regards the savage, and doing less than justice to the world for
    whom such histories have been prepared. I have travelled several years
    already amongst these people and I have not had my scalp taken, nor a
    blow struck me; nor had occasion to raise my hand against an Indian;
    nor has my property been stolen, as yet to my knowledge, to the value
    of a shilling; and that in a country where no man is punishable by
    law for the crime of stealing; still some of them steal, and murder
    too; and if white men did not do the same, and that in defiance of
    the laws of God and man, I might take satisfaction in stigmatizing
    the Indian character as thievish and murderous. That the Indians in
    their <em>native state</em> are “<em>drunken</em>,” is false; for they are
    the only temperance people, literally speaking, that ever I saw in my
    travels, or ever expect to see. If the civilized world are startled at
    this, it is the <em>fact</em> that they must battle with, not with me;
    for these people manufacture no spirituous liquor themselves, and know
    nothing of it until it is brought into their country and tendered to
    them by Christians. That these people are “<em>naked</em>” is equally
    untrue, and as easily disproved; for I am sure that with the paintings
    I have made amongst the Mandans and Crows, and other tribes; and with
    their beautiful costumes which I have procured and shall bring home, I
    shall be able to establish the fact that many of these people dress,
    not only with clothes comfortable for any latitude, but that they also
    dress with some considerable taste and elegance. Nor am I quite sure
    that they are entitled to the name of “<em>poor</em>,” who live in a
    boundless country of green fields, with good horses to ride; where they
    are all joint tenants of the soil, together; where the Great Spirit
    has supplied them with an abundance of food to eat—where they are all
    indulging in the pleasures and amusements of a lifetime of idleness
    and ease, with no business hours to attend to, or professions to
    learn—where they have no notes in bank or other debts to pay—no taxes,
    no tithes, no rents, nor beggars to touch and tax the sympathy of their
    souls at every step they go. Such might be poverty in the Christian
    world, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span> is sure to be a blessing where the pride and insolence of
    comparative wealth are unknown.</p>

  <p>I mentioned that this is the nucleus or place of concentration of
    the numerous tribe of the Sioux, who often congregate here in great
    masses to make their trades with the American Fur Company; and that
    on my way up the river, some months since, I found here encamped,
    six hundred families of Sioux, living in tents covered with buffalo
    hides. Amongst these there were twenty or more of the different bands,
    each one with their chief at their head, over whom was a <em>superior
    chief</em> and leader, a middle-aged man, of middling stature, with
    a noble countenance, and a figure almost equalling the Apollo, and
    I painted his portrait (<a href="#i_086"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 86</a>). The name of this chief
    is Ha-wan-je-tah (the one horn) of the Mee-ne-cow-e-gee band, who
    has risen rapidly to the highest honours in the tribe, from his own
    extraordinary merits, even at so early an age. He told me that he
    took the name of “One Horn” (or shell) from a simple small shell that
    was hanging on his neck, which descended to him from his father, and
    which, he said, he valued more than anything he possessed; affording
    a striking instance of the living affection which these people often
    cherish for the dead, inasmuch as he chose to carry this name through
    life in preference to many others and more honourable ones he had
    a right to have taken, from different battles and exploits of his
    extraordinary life. He treated me with great kindness and attention,
    considering himself highly complimented by the signal and unprecedented
    honour I had conferred upon him by painting his portrait, and that
    before I had invited any other. His costume was a very handsome one,
    and will have a place in my <span class="smcap">Indian Gallery</span> by the side of
    his picture. It is made of elk skins beautifully dressed, and fringed
    with a profusion of porcupine quills and scalp-locks; and his hair,
    which is very long and profuse, divided into two parts, and lifted up
    and crossed, over the top of his head, with a simple tie, giving it
    somewhat the appearance of a Turkish turban.</p>

  <p>This extraordinary man, before he was raised to the dignity of chief,
    was the renowned of his tribe for his athletic achievements. In the
    chase he was foremost; he could run down a buffalo, which he often had
    done, on his own legs, and drive his arrow to the heart. He was the
    fleetest in the tribe; and in the races he had run, he had always taken
    the prize.</p>

  <p>It was proverbial in his tribe, that Ha-wan-je-tah’s bow never was
    drawn in vain, and his wigwam was abundantly furnished with scalps that
    he had taken from his enemies’ heads in battle.</p>

  <p>Having descended the river thus far, then, and having hauled out
    my canoe, and taken up my quarters for awhile with mine hospitable
    host, Mr. Laidlaw, as I have before said; and having introduced my
    readers to the country and the people, and more particularly to the
    chief dignitary of the Sioux; and having promised in the beginning of
    this Letter also, that I should give them some amusing and curious
    information that we picked up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span> and incidents that we met with, on
    our voyage from the Mandans to this place; I have again to beg that
    they will pardon me for withholding from them yet awhile longer, the
    incidents of that curious and most important part of my Tour, the
    absence of which, at this time, seems to make a “hole in the ballad,”
    though I promise my readers they are written, and will appear in the
    book in a proper and appropriate place.</p>

  <p>Taking it for granted then, that I will be indulged in this freak, I am
    taking the liberty of presuming on my readers’ patience in proposing
    another, which is to offer them here an extract from my Notes, which
    were made on my journey of 1300 miles from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis to this place,
    where I stopped, as I have said, amongst several thousands of Sioux;
    where I remained for some time, and painted my numerous portraits of
    their chiefs, &amp;c.; one of whom was the head and leader of the Sioux,
    whom I have already introduced. On the long and tedious route that lies
    between <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis and this place, I passed the Sacs and Ioways—the
    Konzas—the Omahaws, and the Otoes (making notes on them all, which are
    reserved for another place), and landed at the Puncahs, a small tribe
    residing in one village, on the west bank of the river, 300 miles below
    this, and 1000 from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis.</p>

  <p>The Puncahs are all contained in seventy-five or eighty lodges, made of
    buffalo skins, in the form of tents; the frames for which are poles of
    fifteen or twenty feet in length, with the butt ends standing on the
    ground, and the small ends meeting at the top, forming a cone, which
    sheds off the rain and wind with perfect success. This small remnant
    of a tribe are not more than four or five hundred in numbers; and I
    should think, at least, two-thirds of those are women. This disparity
    in numbers having been produced by the continual losses which their
    men suffer, who are penetrating the buffalo country for meat, for
    which they are now obliged to travel a great way (as the buffaloes
    have recently left their country), exposing their lives to their more
    numerous enemies about them.</p>

  <p>The chief of this tribe, whose name is Shoo-de-ga-cha (smoke), I
    painted at full length (<a href="#i_087"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 87</a>), and his wife also, a young
    and very pretty woman (<a href="#i_088"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 88</a>), whose name is Hee-la’h-dee
    (the pure fountain); her neck and arms were curiously tattooed, which
    is a very frequent mode of ornamenting the body amongst this and some
    other tribes, which is done by pricking into the skin, gunpowder and
    vermilion.</p>

  <p>The chief, who was wrapped in a buffalo robe, is a noble specimen of
    native dignity and philosophy. I conversed much with him; and from his
    dignified manners, as well as from the soundness of his reasoning, I
    became fully convinced that he deserved to be the sachem of a more
    numerous and prosperous tribe. He related to me with great coolness
    and frankness, the poverty and distress of his nation; and with the
    method of a philosopher, predicted the certain and rapid extinction of
    his tribe, which he had not the power to avert. Poor, noble chief; who
    was equal to, and worthy of a greater empire! He sat upon the deck of
    the steamer, overlooking the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span> cluster of his wigwams mingled
    amongst the trees; and, like Caius Marius, weeping over the ruins
    of Carthage, shed tears as he was descanting on the poverty of his
    ill-fated little community, which he told me “had once been powerful
    and happy; that the buffaloes which the Great Spirit had given them
    for food, and which formerly spread all over their green prairies, had
    all been killed or driven out by the approach of white men, who wanted
    their skins; that their country was now entirely destitute of game,
    and even of roots for their food, as it was one continued prairie;
    and that his young men penetrating the countries of their enemies
    for buffaloes, which they were obliged to do, were cut to pieces and
    destroyed in great numbers. That his people had foolishly become fond
    of <em>fire-water</em> (whiskey), and had given away everything in their
    country for it—that it had destroyed many of his warriors, and soon
    would destroy the rest—that his tribe was too small, and his warriors
    too few to go to war with the tribes around them; that they were met
    and killed by the Sioux on the North, by the Pawnees on the West; and
    by the Osages and Konzas on the South; and still more alarmed from the
    constant advance of the pale faces—their enemies from the East, with
    whiskey and small-pox, which already had destroyed four-fifths of his
    tribe, and soon would impoverish, and at last destroy the remainder of
    them.”</p>

  <p>In this way did this shrewd philosopher lament over the unlucky destiny
    of his tribe; and I pitied him with all my heart. I have no doubt of
    the correctness of his representations; and I believe there is no tribe
    on the frontier more in want, nor any more deserving of the sympathy
    and charity of the government and Christian societies of the civilized
    world.</p>

  <p>The son of this chief, a youth of eighteen years, and whose portrait
    I painted (<a href="#i_090"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 90</a>), distinguished himself in a singular
    manner the day before our steamer reached their village, by taking to
    him <em>four wives in one day</em>! This extraordinary and unprecedented
    freak of his, was just the thing to make him the greatest sort of
    <em>medicine</em> in the eyes of his people; and probably he may date
    much of his success and greatness through life, to this bold and
    original step, which suddenly raised him into notice and importance.</p>

  <p>The old chief Shoo-de-ga-cha, of whom I have spoken above, considering
    his son to have arrived to the age of maturity, fitted him out for
    house-keeping, by giving him a handsome wigwam to live in, and nine
    horses, with many other valuable presents; when the boy, whose name
    is Hongs-kay-de (the great chief), soon laid his plans for the proud
    and pleasant epoch in his life, and consummated them in the following
    ingenious and amusing manner.</p>

  <p>Wishing to connect himself with, and consequently to secure the
    countenance of some of the most influential men in the tribe, he had
    held an interview with one of the most distinguished; and easily
    (being the son of a chief), made an arrangement for the hand of his
    daughter, which he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span> to receive on a certain day, and at a certain
    hour, for which he was to give two horses, a gun, and several pounds
    of tobacco. This was enjoined on the father as a profound secret, and
    as a condition of the espousal. In like manner he soon made similar
    arrangements with three other leading men of the tribe, each of whom
    had a young and beautiful daughter, of marriageable age. To each of
    the fathers he had promised two horses, and other presents similar
    to those stipulated for in the first instance, and all under the
    same injunctions of secrecy, until the hour approached, when he had
    announced to the whole tribe that he was to be married. At the time
    appointed, they all assembled, and all were in ignorance of the fair
    hand that was to be placed in his on this occasion. He had got some
    of his young friends who were prepared to assist him, to lead up
    the eight horses. He took two of them by the halters, and the other
    presents agreed upon in his other hand, and advancing to the first of
    the parents, whose daughter was standing by the side of him, saying
    to him, “you promised me the hand of your daughter on this day, for
    which I was to give you two horses.” The father assented with a “ugh!”
    receiving the presents, and giving his child; when some confusion
    ensued from the simultaneous remonstrances, which were suddenly made by
    the other three parents, who had brought their daughters forward, and
    were shocked at this sudden disappointment, as well as by the mutual
    declarations they were making, of similar contracts that each one had
    entered into with him! As soon as they could be pacified, and silence
    was restored, he exultingly replied, “You have all acknowledged in
    public your promises with me, which I shall expect you to fulfil. I am
    here to perform all the engagements which I have made, and I expect
    you all to do the same”—No more was said. He led up the two horses for
    each, and delivered the other presents; leading off to his wigwam his
    four brides—taking two in each hand, and commenced at once upon his new
    mode of life; reserving only one of his horses for his own daily use.</p>

  <p>I visited the wigwam of this young installed <em>medicine-man</em>
    several times, and saw his four modest little wives seated around the
    fire, where all seemed to harmonize very well; and for aught I could
    discover, were entering very happily on the duties and pleasures of
    married life. I selected one of them for her portrait, and painted it
    (<a href="#i_089"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 89</a>), Mong-shong-shaw (the bending willow), in a very
    pretty dress of deer skins, and covered with a young buffalo’s robe,
    which was handsomely ornamented, and worn with much grace and pleasing
    effect.</p>

  <p>Mr. Chouteau of the Fur Company, and Major Sanford, the agent for the
    Upper Missouri Indians, were with me at this time; and both of these
    gentlemen, highly pleased with so ingenious and <em>innocent</em> a
    freak, felt disposed to be liberal, and sent them many presents from
    the steamer.</p>

  <p>The ages of these young brides were probably all between twelve and
    fifteen years, the season of life in which most of the girls in this
    wild country contract marriage.</p>

  <figure class="illowp75 mt2" id="i_091">

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

  <p>It is a surprising fact, that women mature in these regions at that
    early age, and there have been some instances where marriage has taken
    place, even at eleven; and the juvenile mother has been blest with her
    first offspring at the age of twelve!</p>

  <p>These facts are calculated to create surprise and almost incredulity
    in the mind of the reader, but there are circumstances for his
    consideration yet to be known, which will in a manner account for these
    extraordinary facts.</p>

  <p>There is not a doubt but there is a more early approach to maturity
    amongst the females of this country than in civilized communities,
    owing either to a natural and constitutional difference, or to the
    exposed and active life they lead. Yet there is another and more
    general cause of early marriages (and consequently apparent maturity),
    which arises out of the modes and forms of the country, where most
    of the marriages are contracted with the parents, hurried on by the
    impatience of the applicant, and prematurely accepted and consummated
    on the part of the parents, who are often impatient to be in receipt
    of the presents they are to receive as the price of their daughters.
    There is also the facility of dissolving the marriage contract in this
    country, which does away with one of the most serious difficulties
    which lies in the way in the civilized world, and calculated greatly
    to retard its consummation, which is not an equal objection in Indian
    communities. Education and accomplishments, again, in the fashionable
    world, and also a time and a season to flourish and show them off,
    necessarily engross that part of a young lady’s life, when the poor
    Indian girl, who finds herself weaned from the familiar embrace of her
    parents, with her mind and her body maturing, and her thoughts and her
    passions straying away in the world for some theme or some pleasure
    to cling to, easily follows their juvenile and ardent dictates,
    prematurely entering on that system of life, consisting in reciprocal
    dependence and protection.</p>

  <p>In the instance above described, the young man was in no way censured
    by his people, but most loudly applauded; for in this country polygamy
    is allowed; and in this tribe, where there are two or three times the
    number of women that there are of men, such an arrangement answers a
    good purpose, whereby so many of the females are provided for and taken
    care of; and particularly so, and to the great satisfaction of the
    tribe, as well as of the parties and families concerned, when so many
    fall to the lot of a chief, or the son of a chief, into whose wigwam it
    is considered an honour to be adopted, and where they are the most sure
    of protection.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MOUTH OF TETON RIVER, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">When</span> we were about to start on our way up the river from the village
    of the Puncahs, we found that they were packing up all their goods and
    preparing to start for the prairies, farther to the West, in pursuit
    of buffaloes, to dry meat for their winter’s supplies. They took down
    their wigwams of skins to carry with them, and all were flat to the
    ground and everything packing up ready for the start. My attention
    was directed by Major Sanford, the Indian Agent, to one of the most
    miserable and helpless looking objects that I ever had seen in my life,
    a very aged and emaciated man of the tribe, who he told me was to be
    <em>exposed</em>.</p>

  <p>The tribe were going where hunger and dire necessity compelled them
    to go, and this pitiable object, who had once been a chief, and a man
    of distinction in his tribe, who was now too old to travel, being
    reduced to mere skin and bones, was to be left to starve, or meet
    with such death as might fall to his lot, and his bones to be picked
    by the wolves! I lingered around this poor old forsaken patriarch for
    hours before we started, to indulge the tears of sympathy which were
    flowing for the sake of this poor benighted and decrepit old man,
    whose worn-out limbs were no longer able to support him; their kind
    and faithful offices having long since been performed, and his body
    and his mind doomed to linger into the withering agony of decay, and
    gradual solitary death. I wept, and it was a pleasure to weep, for the
    painful looks, and the dreary prospects of this old veteran, whose
    eyes were dimmed, whose venerable locks were whitened by an hundred
    years, whose limbs were almost naked, and trembling as he sat by a
    small fire which his friends had left him, with a few sticks of wood
    within his reach and a buffalo’s skin stretched upon some crotches over
    his head. Such was to be his only dwelling, and such the chances for
    his life, with only a few half-picked bones that were laid within his
    reach, and a dish of water, without weapons or means of any kind to
    replenish them, or strength to move his body from its fatal locality.
    In this sad plight I mournfully contemplated this miserable remnant
    of existence, who had unluckily outlived the fates and accidents of
    wars to die alone, at death’s leisure. His friends and his children
    had all left him, and were preparing in a little time to be on the
    march. He had told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span> them to leave him, “he was old,” he said, “and too
    feeble to march.” “My children,” said he, “our nation is poor, and it
    is necessary that you should all go to the country where you can get
    meat,—my eyes are dimmed and my strength is no more; my days are nearly
    all numbered, and I am a burthen to my children—I cannot go, and I wish
    to die. Keep your hearts stout, and think not of me; I am no longer
    good for anything.” In this way they had finished the ceremony of
    <em>exposing</em> him, and taken their final leave of him. I advanced to
    the old man, and was undoubtedly the last human being who held converse
    with him. I sat by the side of him, and though he could not distinctly
    see me, he shook me heartily by the hand and smiled, evidently aware
    that I was a white man, and that I sympathized with his inevitable
    misfortune. I shook hands again with him, and left him, steering my
    course towards the steamer which was a mile or more from me, and ready
    to resume her voyage up the Missouri.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

  <p>This cruel custom of exposing their aged people, belongs, I think, to
    all the tribes who roam about the prairies, making severe marches,
    when such decrepit persons are totally unable to go, unable to ride or
    to walk,—when they have no means of carrying them. It often becomes
    absolutely necessary in such cases that they should be left; and they
    uniformly insist upon it, saying as this old man did, that they are
    old and of no further use—that they left their fathers in the same
    manner—that they wish to die, and their children must not mourn for
    them.</p>

  <p>From the Puncah village, our steamer made regular progress from day
    to day towards the mouth of the Teton, from where I am now writing;
    passing the whole way a country of green fields, that come sloping down
    to the river on either side, forming the loveliest scenes in the world.</p>

  <p>From day to day we advanced, opening our eyes to something new and
    more beautiful every hour that we progressed, until at last our boat
    was aground; and a day’s work of sounding told us at last, that there
    was no possibility of advancing further, until there should be a rise
    in the river, to enable the boat to get over the bar. After laying in
    the middle of the river about a week, in this unpromising dilemma, Mr.
    Chouteau started off twenty men on foot, to cross the plains for a
    distance of 200 miles to Laidlaw’s Fort, at the mouth of Teton river.
    To this expedition, I immediately attached myself; and having heard
    that a numerous party of Sioux were there encamped, and waiting to see
    the steamer, I packed on the backs, and in the hands of several of the
    men, such articles for painting, as I might want; canvass, paints, and
    brushes, with my sketch-book slung on my back, and my rifle in my hand,
    and I started off with them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span></p>

  <p>We took leave of our friends on the boat, and mounting the green
    bluffs, steered our course from day to day over a level prairie,
    without a tree or a bush in sight, to relieve the painful monotony,
    filling our canteens at the occasional little streams that we passed,
    kindling our fires with dried buffalo dung, which we collected on the
    prairie, and stretching our tired limbs on the level turf whenever we
    were overtaken by night.</p>

  <p>We were six or seven days in performing this march; and it gave me a
    good opportunity of testing the muscles of my legs, with a number of
    half-breeds and Frenchmen, whose lives are mostly spent in this way,
    leading a novice, a cruel, and almost killing journey. Every rod of our
    way was over a continuous prairie, with a verdant green turf of wild
    grass of six or eight inches in height; and most of the way enamelled
    with wild flowers, and filled with a profusion of strawberries.</p>

  <p>For two or three of the first days, the scenery was monotonous,
    and became exceedingly painful from the fact, that we were (to use
    a phrase of the country) “out of sight of land,” <i>i. e.</i> out
    of sight of anything rising above the horizon, which was a perfect
    straight line around us, like that of the blue and boundless ocean. The
    pedestrian over such a discouraging sea of green, without a landmark
    before or behind him; without a beacon to lead him on, or define his
    progress, feels weak and overcome when night falls; and he stretches
    his exhausted limbs, apparently on the same spot where he has slept
    the night before, with the same prospect before and behind him; the
    same grass, and the same wild flowers beneath and about him; the same
    canopy over his head, and the same cheerless sea of green to start
    upon in the morning. It is difficult to describe the simple beauty
    and serenity of these scenes of solitude, or the feelings of feeble
    man, whose limbs are toiling to carry him through them—without a hill
    or tree to mark his progress, and convince him that he is not, like a
    squirrel in his cage, after all his toil, standing still. One commences
    on peregrinations like these, with a light heart, and a nimble foot,
    and spirits as buoyant as the very air that floats along by the side
    of him; but his spirit soon tires, and he lags on the way that is
    rendered more tedious and intolerable by the tantalizing <em>mirage</em>
    that opens before him beautiful lakes, and lawns, and copses; or by
    the <em>looming</em> of the prairie ahead of him, that seems to rise in
    a parapet, and decked with its varied flowers, phantom-like, flies and
    moves along before him.</p>

  <p>I got on for a couple of days in tolerable condition, and with some
    considerable applause; but my half-bred, companions took the lead at
    length, and left me with several other novices far behind, which gave
    me additional pangs; and I at length felt like giving up the journey,
    and throwing myself upon the ground in hopeless despair. I was not
    alone in my misery, however, but was cheered and encouraged by looking
    back and beholding several of our party half a mile or more in the rear
    of me, jogging along, and suffering more agony in their new experiment
    than I was suffering myself. Their loitering and my murmurs, at length,
    brought our leaders to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span> halt, and we held a sort of council, in which
    I explained that the pain in my feet was so intolerable, that I felt as
    if I could go no further; when one of our half-breed leaders stepped
    up to me, and addressing me in French, told me that I must “<em>turn my
    toes in</em>” as the Indians do, and that I could then go on very well.
    We halted a half-hour, and took a little refreshment, whilst the little
    Frenchman was teaching his lesson to the rest of my fellow-novices,
    when we took up our march again; and I soon found upon trial, that by
    turning my toes in, my feet went more easily through the grass; and by
    turning the weight of my body more equally on the toes (enabling each
    one to support its proportionable part of the load, instead of throwing
    it all on to the joints of the big toes, which is done when the toes
    are turned out); I soon got relief, and made my onward progress very
    well. I rigidly adhered to this mode, and found no difficulty on the
    third and fourth days, of taking the lead of the whole party, which I
    constantly led until our journey was completed.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

  <p>On this journey we saw immense herds of buffaloes; and although we
    had no horses to <em>run</em> them, we successfully <em>approached</em>
    them on foot, and supplied ourselves abundantly with fresh meat. After
    travelling for several days, we came in sight of a high range of blue
    hills in distance on our left, which rose to the height of several
    hundred feet above the level of the prairies. These hills were a
    conspicuous landmark at last, and some relief to us. I was told by our
    guide, that they were called the Bijou Hills, from a Fur Trader of that
    name, who had had his trading-house at the foot of them on the banks of
    the Missouri river, where he was at last destroyed by the Sioux Indians.</p>

  <p>Not many miles back of this range of hills, we came in contact with an
    immense saline, or “salt meadow,” as they are termed in this country,
    which turned us out of our path, and compelled us to travel several
    miles out of our way, to get by it; we came suddenly upon a great
    depression of the prairie, which extended for several miles, and as
    we stood upon its green banks, which were gracefully sloping down, we
    could overlook some hundreds of acres of the prairie which were covered
    with an incrustation of salt, that appeared the same as if the ground
    was everywhere covered with snow.</p>

  <p>These scenes, I am told are frequently to be met with in these regions,
    and certainly present the most singular and startling effect, by the
    sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
    and unexpected contrast between their snow-white appearance, and the
    green fields that hem them in on all sides. Through each of these
    meadows there is a meandering small stream which arises from salt
    springs, throwing out in the spring of the year great quantities of
    water, which flood over these meadows to the depth of three or four
    feet; and during the heat of summer, being exposed to the rays of the
    sun, entirely evaporates, leaving the incrustation of <em>muriate</em>
    on the surface, to the depth of one or two inches. These places are
    the constant resort of buffaloes, which congregate in thousands about
    them, to lick up the salt; and on approaching the banks of this place
    we stood amazed at the almost incredible numbers of these animals,
    which were in sight on the opposite banks, at the distance of a mile or
    two from us, where they were lying in countless numbers, on the level
    prairie above, and stretching down by hundreds, to lick at the salt,
    forming in distance, large masses of black, most pleasingly to contrast
    with the snow white, and the vivid green, which I have before mentioned.</p>

  <p>After several days toil in the manner above-mentioned, all the way
    over soft and green fields, and amused with many pleasing incidents
    and accidents of the chase, we arrived, pretty well jaded, at Fort
    Pierre, mouth of Teton River, from whence I am now writing; where for
    the first time I was introduced to Mr. M‘Kenzie (of whom I have before
    spoken), to Mr. Laidlaw, mine host, and Mr. Halsey, a chief clerk in
    the establishment; and after, to the head chief and dignitaries of the
    great Sioux nation, who were here encamped about the Fort, in six or
    seven hundred skin lodges, and waiting for the arrival of the steamer,
    which they had heard, was on its way up the river, and which they had
    great curiosity to see.</p>

  <p>After resting a few days, and recovering from the fatigues of my
    journey, having taken a fair survey of the Sioux village, and explained
    my views to the Indians, as well as to the gentlemen whom I have
    above named; I commenced my operations with the brush, and first of
    all painted the portrait of the head-chief of the Sioux (the one
    horn), whom I have before spoken of. This truly noble fellow sat for
    his portrait, and it was finished before any one of the tribe knew
    anything of it; several of the chiefs and doctors were allowed to see
    it, and at last it was talked of through the village; and of course,
    the greater part of their numbers were at once gathered around me.
    Nothing short of hanging it out of doors on the side of my wigwam,
    would in any way answer them; and here I had the peculiar satisfaction
    of beholding, through a small hole I had made in my wigwam, the high
    admiration and respect they all felt for their chief, as well as
    the very great estimation in which they held me as a painter and a
    magician, conferring upon me at once the very distinguished appellation
    of Ee-cha-zoo-kah-ga-wa-kon (the medicine painter).</p>

  <p>After the exhibition of this chief’s picture, there was much excitement
    in the village about it; the doctors generally took a decided and noisy
    stand against the operations of my brush; haranguing the populace, and
    predicting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span> bad luck, and premature death, to all who submitted to so
    strange and unaccountable an operation! My business for some days was
    entirely at a stand for want of sitters; for the doctors were opposing
    me with all their force; and the women and children were crying, with
    their hands over their mouths, making the most pitiful and doleful
    laments, which I never can explain to my readers; but for some just
    account of which, I must refer them to my friends M‘Kenzie and Halsey,
    who overlooked with infinite amusement, these curious scenes and are
    able, no doubt, to give them with truth and effect to the world.</p>

  <p>In this sad and perplexing dilemma, this noble chief stepped forward,
    and addressing himself to the chiefs and the doctors, to the braves and
    to the women and children, he told them to be quiet, and to treat me
    with friendship; that I had been travelling a great way to see them,
    and smoke with them; that I was great <em>medicine</em>, to be sure; that
    I was a great chief, and that I was the friend of Mr. Laidlaw and Mr.
    M‘Kenzie, who had prevailed upon him to sit for his picture, and fully
    assured him that there was no harm in it. His speech had the desired
    effect, and I was shaken hands with by hundreds of their worthies, many
    of whom were soon dressed and ornamented, prepared to sit for their
    portraits.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

  <p>The first who then stepped forward for his portrait was Ee-ah-sa-pa
    (the Black Rock) chief of the Nee-caw-wee-gee band (<a href="#i_091"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 91</a>),
    a tall and fine looking man, of six feet or more in stature; in a
    splendid dress, with his lance in his hand; with his pictured robe
    thrown gracefully over his shoulders, and his head-dress made of
    war-eagles’ quills and ermine skins, falling in a beautiful crest over
    his back, quite down to his feet, and surmounted on the top with a pair
    of horns denoting him (as I have explained in former instances) head
    leader or war-chief of his band.</p>

  <p>This man has been a constant and faithful friend of Mr. M‘Kenzie and
    others of the Fur Traders, who held him in high estimation, both as an
    honourable and valiant man, and an estimable companion.</p>

  <p>The next who sat to me was Tchan-dee, tobacco (<a href="#i_092"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 92</a>),
    a desperate warrior, and represented to me by the traders, as one
    of the most respectable and famous chiefs of the tribe. After him
    sat Toh-ki-ee-to, the stone with horns (<a href="#i_092"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 93</a>), chief
    of the Yanc-ton band, and reputed the principal and most eloquent
    <em>orator</em> of the nation. The neck, and breast, and shoulders
    of this man, were curiously tattooed, by pricking in gunpowder and
    vermilion, which in this extraordinary instance, was put on in
    such elaborate profusion as to appear at a little distance like a
    beautifully embroidered dress. In his hand he held a handsome pipe,
    the stem of which was several feet long, and all the way wound with
    ornamented braids of the porcupine quills. Around his body was wrapped
    a valued robe, made of the skin of the grizzly bear, and on his neck
    several strings of <em>wampum</em>, an ornament seldom seen amongst the
    Indians in the Far West and the North.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> I was much amused with the
    excessive vanity and egotism of this notorious man, who, whilst sitting
    for his picture, took occasion to have the interpreter constantly
    explaining to me the wonderful effects which his oratory had at
    different times produced on the minds of the chiefs and people of his
    tribe.</p>

  <p>He told me, that it was a very easy thing for him to set all the women
    of the tribe to crying: and that all the chiefs listened profoundly to
    his voice before they went to war; and at last, summed up by saying,
    that he was “the greatest orator in the Sioux nation,” by which he
    undoubtedly meant the greatest in the <em>world</em>.</p>

  <p>Besides these <i lang="fr">distingués</i> of this great and powerful tribe, I
    painted in regular succession, according to their rank and standing,
    Wan-ee-ton, chief of the <em>Susseton band</em>; Tah-zee-kah-da-cha
    (the torn belly), a brave of the <em>Yancton band</em>; Ka-pes-ka-day
    (the shell), a brave of the <em>O-gla-la band</em>; Wuk-mi-ser (corn),
    a warrior of the <em>Nee-cow-ee-gee band</em>; Cha-tee-wah-nee-chee
    (no heart), chief of the <em>Wah-nee-watch-to-nee-nah band</em>;
    Mah-to-ra-rish-nee-eeh-ee-rah (the grizzly bear that runs without
    regard), a brave of the <em>Onc-pa-pa band</em>; Mah-to-chee-ga (the
    little bear), a distinguished brave; Shon-ka (the dog), chief of the
    <em>Ca-za-zhee-ta</em> (bad arrow points) <em>band</em>; Tah-teck-a-da-hair
    (the steep wind), a brave of the same band; Hah-ha-ra-pah (the elk’s
    head), chief of the <em>Ee-ta-sip-shov band</em>; Mah-to-een-nah-pa (the
    white bear that goes out), chief of the <em>Blackfoot Sioux band</em>;
    Shon-ga-ton-ga-chesh-en-day (the horse dung), chief of a band, a great
    conjuror and magician.</p>

  <p>The portraits of all the above dignitaries can be always seen, as large
    as life, in my very numerous Collection, provided I get them safe
    home; and also the portraits of two very pretty Sioux women (<a href="#i_094"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    94</a>), Wi-looh-tah-eeh-tchah-ta-mah-nee (the red thing that touches
    in marching), and (<a href="#i_094"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 95</a>), Tchon-su-mons-ka (the sand bar).
    The first of these women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
    (<a href="#i_094"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 94</a>), is the daughter of the famous chief called
    Black Rock, of whom I have spoken, and whose portrait has been given
    (<a href="#i_091"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 91</a>). She is an unmarried girl, and much esteemed by the
    whole tribe, for her modesty, as well as beauty. She was beautifully
    dressed in skins, ornamented profusely with brass buttons and beads.
    Her hair was plaited, her ears supported a great profusion of curious
    beads—and over her other dress she wore a handsomely garnished buffalo robe.</p>

  <p>So highly was the Black Rock esteemed (as I have before mentioned), and
    his beautiful daughter admired and respected by the Traders, that Mr.
    M‘Kenzie employed me to make him copies of their two portraits, which
    he has hung up in Mr. Laidlaw’s trading-house, as valued ornaments and
    keepsakes.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

  <p>The second of these women (<a href="#i_094"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 95</a>) was very richly dressed,
    the upper part of her garment being almost literally covered with brass
    buttons; and her hair, which was inimitably beautiful and soft, and
    glossy as silk, fell over her shoulders in great profusion, and in
    beautiful waves, produced by the condition in which it is generally
    kept in braids, giving to it, when combed out, a waving form, adding
    much to its native appearance, which is invariably straight and
    graceless.</p>

  <p>This woman is at present the wife of a white man by the name of
    Chardon, a Frenchman, who has been many years in the employment of the
    American Fur Company, in the character of a Trader and Interpreter;
    and who by his bold and daring nature, has not only carried dread and
    consternation amongst the Indian tribes wherever he has gone; but
    has commanded much respect, and rendered essential service to the
    Company in the prosecution of their dangerous and critical dealings
    with the Indian tribes. I have said something of this extraordinary
    man heretofore, and shall take future occasion to say more of him.
    For the present, suffice it to say, that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>although from his continual
    intercourse with the different tribes for twenty-five or thirty years,
    where he had always been put forward in the front of danger—sent as
    a sacrifice, or <em>forlorn hope</em>; still his cut and hacked limbs
    have withstood all the blows that have been aimed at them; and his
    unfaltering courage leads him to “beard the lion in his den,” whilst
    his liberal heart, as it always has, deals out to his friends (and even
    to strangers, if friends are not by) all the dear earnings which are
    continually bought with severest toil, and at the hazard of his life.</p>

  <p>I acknowledge myself a debtor to this good hearted fellow for much
    kindness and attention to me whilst in the Indian country, and also for
    a superb dress and robe, which had been manufactured and worn by his
    wife, and which he insisted on adding to my <span class="smcap">Indian Gallery</span>
    since her death, where it will long remain to be examined.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

  <div class="footnotes">
    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> When passing by the site of the Puncah village a few
        months after this, in my canoe, I went ashore with my men, and found
        the poles and the buffalo skin, standing as they were left, over the
        old man’s head. The firebrands were lying nearly as I had left them,
        and I found at a few yards distant the skull, and others of his bones,
        which had been picked and cleaned by the wolves; which is probably all
        that any human being can ever know of his final and melancholy fate.
    </div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> On this march we were all travelling in moccasins, which
        being made without any soles, according to the Indian custom, had
        but little support for the foot underneath; and consequently, soon
        subjected us to excruciating pain, whilst walking according to the
        civilized mode, with the toes turned out. From this very painful
        experience I learned to my complete satisfaction, that man in a state
        of nature who walks on his naked feet, <em>must</em> walk with his
        toes turned in, that each may perform the duties assigned to it in
        proportion to its size and strength; and that civilized man <em>can</em>
        walk with his toes turned out if he chooses, if he will use a stiff
        sole under his feet, and will be content at last to put up with an
        acquired deformity of the big toe joint which too many know to be a
        frequent and painful occurrence.
    </div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> Several years after I painted the portrait of this
        extraordinary man, and whilst I was delivering my Lectures in the
        City of New York, I first received intelligence of his death, in the
        following singular manner:—I was on the platform in my Lecture-room,
        in the Stuyvesant Institute, with an audience of twelve or fourteen
        hundred persons, in the midst of whom were seated a delegation of
        thirty or forty Sioux Indians under the charge of Major Pilcher, their
        agent; and I was successfully passing before their eyes the portraits
        of a number of Sioux chiefs, and making my remarks upon them. The Sioux
        instantly recognized each one as it was exhibited, which they instantly
        hailed by a sharp and startling yelp. But when the portrait of this
        chief was placed before them, instead of the usual recognition, each
        one placed his hand over his mouth, and gave a “hush—sh—” and hung
        down their heads, their usual expressions of grief in case of a death.
        From this sudden emotion, I knew instantly, that the chief must be
        dead, and so expressed my belief to the audience. I stopped my Lecture
        a few moments to converse with Major Pilcher who was by my side, and
        who gave me the following extraordinary account of his death, which I
        immediately related to the audience; and which being translated to the
        Sioux Indians, their chief arose and addressed himself to the audience,
        saying that the account was true, and that Ha-wan-je-tah was killed but
        a few days before they left home.

      <p>The account which Major Pilcher gave was nearly as follows:—</p>

      <p>“But a few weeks before I left the Sioux country with the delegation,
        Ha-wan-je-tah (the one horn) had in some way been the accidental cause
        of the death of his only son, a very fine youth; and so great was the
        anguish of his mind at times, that he became frantic and insane. In one
        of these moods he mounted his favourite war-horse with his bow and his
        arrows in his hand, and dashed off at full speed upon the prairies,
        repeating the most solemn oath, ‘that he would slay the first living
        thing that fell in his way, be it man or beast, or friend or foe.’</p>

      <p>“No one dared to follow him, and after he had been absent an hour
        or two, his horse came back to the village with two arrows in its
        body, and covered with blood! Fears of the most serious kind were
        now entertained for the fate of the chief, and a party of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span> warriors
        immediately mounted their horses, and retraced the animal’s tracks to
        the place of the tragedy, where they found the body of their chief
        horribly mangled and gored by a buffalo bull, whose carcass was
        stretched by the side of him.</p>

      <p>“A close examination of the ground was then made by the Indians, who
        ascertained by the tracks, that their unfortunate chief, under his
        unlucky resolve, had met a buffalo bull in the season when they are
        very stubborn, and unwilling to run from any one; and had incensed
        the animal by shooting a number of arrows into him, which had brought
        him into furious combat. The chief had then dismounted, and turned
        his horse loose, having given it a couple of arrows from his bow,
        which sent it home at full speed, and then had thrown away his bow and
        quiver, encountering the infuriated animal with his knife alone, and
        the desperate battle resulted as I have before-mentioned, in the death
        of both. Many of the bones of the chief were broken, as he was gored
        and stamped to death, and his huge antagonist had laid his body by the
        side of him, weltering in blood from an hundred wounds made by the
        chief’s long and two-edged knife.”</p>

      <p>So died this elegant and high-minded nobleman of the wilderness, whom I
        confidently had hoped to meet and admire again at some future period of
        my life. (<i>Vide</i> <a href="#i_086"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 86</a>).</p>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> <em>Wampum</em> is the Indian name of ornaments
        manufactured by the Indians from vari-coloured shells, which they get
        on the shores of the fresh water streams, and file or cut into bits
        of half an inch, or an inch in length, and perforate (giving to them
        the shape of pieces of broken pipe stems), which they string on deers’
        sinews, and wear on their necks in profusion; or weave them ingeniously
        into war-belts for the waist.

      <p>Amongst the numerous tribes who have formerly inhabited the Atlantic
        Coast, and that part of the country which now constitutes the principal
        part of the United States, wampum has been invariably manufactured, and
        highly valued as a circulating medium (instead of coins, of which the
        Indians have no knowledge); so many strings, or so many hands-breadth,
        being the fixed value of a horse, a gun, a robe, &amp;c.</p>

      <p>In treaties, the wampum belt has been passed as the pledge of
        friendship, and from time immemorial sent to hostile tribes, as the
        messenger of peace; or paid by so many fathoms length, as tribute to
        conquering enemies, and Indian kings.</p>

      <p>It is a remarkable fact, and worthy of observation in this place, that
        after I passed the Mississippi, I saw but very little wampum used; and
        on ascending the Missouri, I do not recollect to have seen it worn at
        all by the Upper Missouri Indians, although the same materials for its
        manufacture are found in abundance through those regions. I met with
        but very few strings of it amongst the Missouri Sioux, and nothing of
        it amongst the tribes north and west of them. Below the Sioux, and
        along the whole of our Western frontier, the different tribes are found
        loaded and beautifully ornamented with it, which they can now afford
        to do, for they consider it of little value, as the Fur Traders have
        ingeniously introduced a spurious imitation of it, manufactured by
        steam or otherwise, of porcelain or some composition closely resembling
        it, with which they have flooded the whole Indian country, and sold at
        so reduced a price, as to cheapen, and consequently destroy, the value
        and meaning of the original wampum, a string of which can now but very
        rarely be found in any part of the country.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> Several years after I left the Sioux country, I saw
        Messrs. Chardon and Piquot, two of the Traders from that country, who
        recently had left it, and told me in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, whilst looking at the
        portrait of this girl, that while staying in Mr. Laidlaw’s Fort, the
        chief, Black Rock, entered the room suddenly where the portrait of
        his daughter was hanging on the wall, and pointing to it with a heavy
        heart, told Mr. Laidlaw, that whilst his band was out on the prairies,
        where they had been for several months “making meat,” his daughter
        had died, and was there buried. “My heart is glad again,” said he,
        “when I see her here alive; and I want the one the medicine-man made
        of her, which is now before me, that I can see her, and talk to her.
        My band are all in mourning for her, and at the gate of your Fort,
        which I have just passed, are ten horses for you, and Ee-ah-sa-pa’s
        wigwam, which you know is the best one in the Sioux nation. I wish you
        to take down my daughter and give her to me.” Mr. Laidlaw, seeing the
        <em>unusually</em> liberal price that this nobleman was willing to pay
        for a portrait, and the true grief that he expressed for the loss of
        his child, had not the heart to abuse such noble feeling; and taking
        the painting from the wall, placed it into his hands; telling him that
        it of right belonged to him, and that his horses and wigwam he must
        take back and keep them, to mend, as far as possible, his liberal
        heart, which was broken by the loss of his only daughter.

      <a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> Several years since writing the above, I made a visit
        with my wife, to the venerable parent of Mr. Chardon, who lives in her
        snug and neat mansion, near the City of Philadelphia, where we were
        treated with genuine politeness and hospitality. His mother and two
        sisters, who are highly respectable, had many anxious questions to ask
        about him; and had at the same time, living with them, a fine-looking
        half-breed boy, about ten years old, the son of Monsr. Chardon and
        his Indian wife, whom I have above spoken of. This fine boy who had
        received the name of Bolivar, had been brought from the Indian country
        by the father, and left here for his education, with which they were
        taking great pains.

  <div class="subheadc">MOUTH OF TETON RIVER, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> painting the portraits of the chiefs and braves of the Sioux,
    as described in my last epistle, my painting-room was the continual
    rendezvous of the worthies of the tribe; and I, the “lion of the day,”
    and my art, the <i lang="fr">summum</i> and <i lang="fr">ne plus ultra</i> of mysteries,
    which engaged the whole conversation of chiefs and sachems, as well
    as of women and children. I mentioned that I have been obliged to
    paint them according to rank, as they looked upon the operation as a
    very great honour, which I, as “a great chief and medicine-man,” was
    conferring on all who sat to me. Fortunate it was for me, however, that
    the honour was not a sufficient inducement for all to overcome their
    fears, which often stood in the way of their consenting to be painted;
    for if all had been willing to undergo the operation, I should have
    progressed but a very little way in the “<em>rank and file</em>” of their
    worthies; and should have had to leave many discontented, and (as they
    would think) neglected. About one in five or eight was willing to be
    painted, and the rest thought they would be much more sure of “sleeping
    quiet in their graves” after they were dead, if their pictures were
    not made. By this lucky difficulty I got great relief, and easily got
    through with those who were willing, and at the same time decided by
    the chiefs to be worthy, of so signal an honour.</p>

  <p>After I had done with the chiefs and braves, and proposed to paint a
    few of the women, I at once got myself into a serious perplexity, being
    heartily laughed at by the whole tribe, both by men and by women, for
    my exceeding and (to them) unaccountable condescension in seriously
    proposing to paint a woman; conferring on her the same honour that I
    had done the chiefs and braves. Those whom I had honoured, were laughed
    at by hundreds of the jealous, who had been decided unworthy the
    distinction, and were now amusing themselves with the <em>very enviable
    honour</em> which the <em>great white medicine-man</em> had conferred,
    <em>especially</em> on <em>them</em>, and was now to confer equally upon
    the <em>squaws</em>!</p>

  <p>The first reply that I received from those whom I had painted, was,
    that if I was to paint women and children, the sooner I destroyed
    <em>their</em> pictures, the better; for I had represented to them
    that I wanted their pictures to exhibit to white chiefs, to shew who
    were the most distinguished and worthy of the Sioux; and their women
    had never taken scalps, nor did anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span> better than make fires and
    dress skins. I was quite awkward in this dilemma, in explaining to
    them that I wanted the portraits of the women to hang <em>under</em>
    those of their husbands, merely to shew how their women <em>looked</em>,
    and how they <em>dressed</em>, without saying any more of them. After
    some considerable delay of my operations, and much deliberation on
    the subject, through the village, I succeeded in getting a number of
    women’s portraits, of which the two above introduced are a couple.</p>

  <p>The vanity of these men, after they had agreed to be painted was beyond
    all description, and far surpassing that which is oftentimes immodest
    enough in civilized society, where the sitter generally leaves the
    picture, when it is done to speak for, and to take care of, itself;
    while an Indian often lays down, from morning till night, in front of
    his portrait, admiring his own beautiful face, and faithfully guarding
    it from day to day, to save it from accident or harm.</p>

  <p>This <em>watching</em> or <em>guarding</em> their portraits, I have
    observed during all of my travels amongst them as a very curious thing;
    and in many instances, where my colours were not dry, and subjected
    to so many accidents, from the crowds who were gathering about them,
    I have found this peculiar guardianship of essential service to
    me—relieving my mind oftentimes from a great deal of anxiety.</p>

  <p>I was for a long time at a loss for the true cause of so singular
    a peculiarity, but at last learned that it was owing to their
    superstitious notion, that there may be life to a certain extent in the
    picture; and that if harm or violence be done to it, it may in some
    mysterious way, affect their health or do them other injury.</p>

  <p>After I had been several weeks busily at work with my brush in this
    village, and pretty well used to the modes of life in these regions—and
    also familiarly acquainted with all the officers and clerks of the
    Establishment, it was announced one day, that the steamer which we had
    left, was coming in the river below, where all eyes were anxiously
    turned, and all ears were listening; when, at length, we discovered the
    puffing of her steam; and, at last, heard the thundering of her cannon,
    which were firing from her deck.</p>

  <p>The excitement and dismay caused amongst 6000 of these wild people,
    when the steamer came up in front of their village, was amusing in the
    extreme. The steamer was moored at the shore, however; and when Mr.
    Chouteau and Major Sanford, their old friend and agent, walked ashore,
    it seemed to restore their confidence and courage; and the whole
    village gathered in front of the boat, without showing much further
    amazement, or even curiosity about it.</p>

  <p>The steamer rested a week or two at this place before she started on
    her voyage for the head-waters of the Missouri; during which time,
    there was much hilarity and mirth indulged in amongst the Indians, as
    well as with the hands employed in the service of the Fur Company. The
    appearance of a steamer in this wild country was deemed a wonderful
    occurrence, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span> the time of her presence here, looked upon, and used
    as a holiday. Some sharp encounters amongst the trappers, who come
    in here from the mountains, loaded with packs of furs, with sinews
    hardened by long exposure, and seemingly impatient for a <em>fight</em>,
    which is soon given them by some bullying fisticuff-fellow, who steps
    forward and settles the matter in a ring, which is made and strictly
    preserved for <em>fair play</em>, until hard raps, and bloody noses, and
    blind eyes “<em>settle the hash</em>,” and satisfy his trappership to lay
    in bed a week or two, and then graduate, a sober and a civil man.</p>

  <p>Amongst the Indians we have had numerous sights and
    amusements to entertain and some to shock us. Shows of
    dances—ball-plays—horse-racing—foot-racing, and wrestling in abundance.
    Feasting—fasting, and prayers we have also had; and penance and
    tortures, and almost every thing short of self-immolation.</p>

  <p>Some few days after the steamer had arrived, it was announced that
    a grand feast was to be given to the <em>great white chiefs</em>, who
    were visitors amongst them; and preparations were made accordingly
    for it. The two chiefs, Ha-wan-je-tah and Tchan-dee, of whom I have
    before spoken, brought their two tents together, forming the two into a
    semi-circle (<a href="#i_096"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 96</a>), enclosing a space sufficiently large
    to accommodate 150 men; and sat down with that number of the principal
    chiefs and warriors of the Sioux nation; with Mr. Chouteau, Major
    Sanford, the Indian agent, Mr. M‘Kenzie, and myself, whom they had
    invited in due time, and placed on elevated seats in the centre of the
    crescent; while the rest of the company all sat upon the ground, and
    mostly cross-legged, preparatory to the feast being dealt out.</p>

  <p>In the centre of the semi-circle was erected a flag-staff, on which
    was waving a white flag, and to which also was tied the calumet, both
    expressive of their friendly feelings towards us. Near the foot of the
    flag-staff were placed in a row on the ground, six or eight kettles,
    with iron covers on them, shutting them tight, in which were prepared
    the viands for our <em>voluptuous</em> feast. Near the kettles, and on
    the ground also, bottomside upwards, were a number of wooden bowls, in
    which the meat was to be served out. And in front, two or three men,
    who were there placed as waiters, to light the pipes for smoking, and
    also to deal out the food.</p>

  <p>In these positions things stood, and all sat, with thousands climbing
    and crowding around, for a peep at the grand pageant; when at length,
    Ha-wan-je-tah (the one horn), head chief of the nation, rose in front
    of the Indian agent, in a very handsome costume, and addressed him
    thus:—“My father, I am glad to see you here to-day—my heart is always
    glad to see my father when he comes—our Great Father, who sends him
    here is very rich, and we are poor. Our friend Mr. M‘Kenzie, who
    is here, we are also glad to see; we know him well, and we shall
    be sorry when he is gone. Our friend who is on your right-hand we
    all know is very rich; and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span> have heard that he owns the great
    <em>medicine-canoe</em>; he is a good man, and a friend to the red men.
    Our friend the <em>White Medicine</em>, who sits with you, we did not
    know—he came amongst us a stranger, and he has made me very well—all
    the women know it, and think it very good; he has done many curious
    things, and we have all been pleased with him—he has made us much
    amusement—and we know he is great medicine.</p>

    <div class="plate"><i>64</i></div>
    <img src="images/i_098.jpg" alt="" />
     <figcaption>98</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>“My father, I hope you will have pity on us, we are very poor—we offer
    you to-day, not the best that we have got; for we have a plenty of good
    buffalo hump and marrow—but we give you our hearts in this feast—we
    have killed our faithful dogs to feed you—and the Great Spirit will
    seal our friendship. I have no more to say.”</p>

  <p>After these words he took off his beautiful war-eagle head-dress—his
    shirt and leggings—his necklace of grizzly bears’ claws and his
    moccasins; and tying them together, laid them gracefully down at the
    feet of the agent as a present; and laying a handsome pipe on top of
    them, he walked around into an adjoining lodge, where he got a buffalo
    robe to cover his shoulders, and returned to the feast, taking his seat
    which he had before occupied.</p>

  <p>Major Sanford then rose and made a short speech in reply, thanking
    him for the valuable present which he had made him, and for the very
    polite and impressive manner in which it had been done; and sent to the
    steamer for a quantity of tobacco and other presents, which were given
    to him in return. After this, and after several others of the chiefs
    had addressed him in a similar manner; and, like the first, disrobed
    themselves, and thrown their beautiful costumes at his feet, one of the
    three men in front deliberately lit a handsome pipe, and brought it to
    Ha-wan-je-tah to smoke. He took it, and after presenting the stem to
    the North—to the South—to the East, and the West—and then to the Sun
    that was over his head, and pronounced the words “How—how—how!” drew
    a whiff or two of smoke through it, and holding the bowl of it in one
    hand, and its stem in the other, he then held it to each of our mouths,
    as we successively smoked it; after which it was passed around through
    the whole group, who all smoked through it, or as far as its contents
    lasted, when another of the three waiters was ready with a second, and
    at length a third one, in the same way, which lasted through the hands
    of the whole number of guests. This smoking was conducted with the
    strictest adherence to exact and established form, and the feast the
    whole way, to the most positive silence. After the pipe is charged, and
    is being lit, until the time that the chief has drawn the smoke through
    it, it is considered an evil omen for any one to speak; and if any one
    break silence in that time, even in a whisper, the pipe is instantly
    dropped by the chief, and their superstition is such, that they would
    not dare to use it on this occasion; but another one is called for
    and used in its stead. If there is no accident of the kind during the
    smoking, the waiters then proceed to distribute the meat, which is soon
    devoured in the feast.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span></p>

  <p>In his case the lids were raised from the kettles, which were all
    filled with dogs’ meat alone. It being well-cooked, and made into a
    sort of a stew, sent forth a very savoury and pleasing smell, promising
    to be an acceptable and palatable food. Each of us civilized guests had
    a large wooden bowl placed before us, with a huge quantity of dogs’
    flesh floating in a profusion of soup, or rich gravy, with a large
    spoon resting in the dish, made of the buffalo’s horn. In this most
    difficult and painful dilemma we sat; all of us knowing the solemnity
    and good feeling in which it was given, and the absolute necessity of
    falling to, and devouring a little of it. We all tasted it a few times,
    and resigned our dishes, which were quite willingly taken, and passed
    around with others, to every part of the group, who all ate heartily of
    the <em>delicious viands</em>, which were soon dipped out of the kettles,
    and entirely devoured; after which each one arose as he felt disposed,
    and walked off without uttering a word. In this way the feast ended,
    and all retired silently, and gradually, until the ground was left
    vacant to the charge of the waiters or officers, who seemed to have
    charge of it during the whole occasion.</p>

  <p>This feast was unquestionably given to us, as the most undoubted
    evidence they could give us of their friendship; and we, who knew
    the spirit and feeling in which it was given, could not but treat it
    respectfully, and receive it as a very high and marked compliment.</p>

  <p>Since I witnessed it on this occasion, I have been honoured with
    numerous entertainments of the kind amongst the other tribes, which I
    have visited towards the sources of the Missouri, and all conducted in
    the same solemn and impressive manner; from which I feel authorized
    to pronounce the <em>dog-feast</em> a truly religious ceremony, wherein
    the poor Indian sees fit to sacrifice his faithful companion to bear
    testimony to the sacredness of his vows of friendship, and invite his
    friend to partake of its flesh, to remind him forcibly of the reality
    of the sacrifice, and the solemnity of his professions.</p>

  <p>The dog, amongst all Indian tribes, is more esteemed and more valued
    than amongst any part of the civilized world; the Indian who has more
    time to devote to his company, and whose untutored mind more nearly
    assimilates to that of his faithful servant, keeps him closer company,
    and draws him nearer to his heart; they hunt together, and are equal
    sharers in the chase—their bed is one; and on the rocks, and on their
    coats of arms they carve his image as the symbol of fidelity. Yet, with
    all of these he will end his affection with this faithful follower, and
    with tears in his eyes, offer him as a sacrifice to seal the pledge he
    has made to man; because a feast of venison, or of buffalo meat, is
    what is due to every one who enters an Indian’s wigwam; and of course,
    conveys but a passive or neutral evidence, that generally goes for
    nothing.</p>

  <p>I have sat at many of these feasts, and never could but appreciate
    the moral and solemnity of them. I have seen the master take from the
    bowl the head of his victim, and descant on its former affection and
    fidelity with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span> tears in his eyes. And I have seen guests at the same
    time by the side of me, jesting and sneering at the poor Indian’s folly
    and stupidity; and I have said in my heart, that they never deserved a
    name so good or so honourable as that of the poor animal whose bones
    they were picking.</p>

  <p>At the feast which I have been above describing, each of us tasted a
    little of the meat, and passed the dishes on to the Indians, who soon
    demolished everything they contained. We all agreed that the meat was
    well cooked, and seemed to be a well-flavoured and palatable food; and
    no doubt, could have been eaten with a good relish, if we had been
    hungry, and ignorant of the nature of the food we were eating.</p>

  <p>The flesh of these dogs, though apparently relished by the Indians,
    is, undoubtedly, inferior to the venison and buffalo’s meat, of which
    feasts are constantly made where friends are invited, as they are in
    civilized society, to a pleasant and convivial party; from which fact
    alone, it would seem clear, that they have some extraordinary motive,
    at all events, for feasting on the flesh of that useful and faithful
    animal; even when, as in the instance I have been describing, their
    village is well supplied with fresh and dried meat of the buffalo. The
    dog-feast is given, I believe, by all tribes in North America; and
    by them all, I think, this faithful animal, as well as the horse, is
    sacrificed in several different ways, to appease offended Spirits or
    Deities, whom it is considered necessary that they should conciliate in
    this way; and when done, is invariably done by giving the best in the
    herd or the kennel.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MOUTH OF TETON RIVER, <i>UPPER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Another</span> curious and disgusting scene I witnessed in the after part of
    the day on which we were honoured with the dog feast. In this I took no
    part, but was sufficiently near to it, when standing some rods off, and
    witnessing the cruel operation. I was called upon by one of the clerks
    in the Establishment to ride up a mile or so, near the banks of the
    Teton River, in a little plain at the base of the bluffs, where were
    grouped some fifteen or twenty lodges of the Ting-ta-to-ah band, to see
    a man (as they said) “<em>looking at the sun</em>!” We found him naked,
    except his breech-cloth, with splints or skewers run through the flesh
    on both breasts, leaning back and hanging with the weight of his body
    to the top of a pole which was fastened in the ground, and to the upper
    end of which he was fastened by a cord which was tied to the splints.
    In this position he was leaning back, with nearly the whole weight
    of his body hanging to the pole, the top of which was bent forward,
    allowing his body to sink about half-way to the ground (<a href="#i_097"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    97</a>). His feet were still upon the ground, supporting a small part
    of his weight; and he held in his left hand his favourite bow, and in
    his right, with a desperate grip, his medicine-bag. In this condition,
    with the blood trickling down over his body, which was covered with
    white and yellow clay, and amidst a great crowd who were looking on,
    sympathizing with and encouraging him, he was hanging and “looking at
    the sun,” without paying the least attention to any one about him.
    In the group that was reclining around him, were several mystery-men
    beating their drums and shaking their rattles, and singing as loud as
    they could yell, to encourage him and strengthen his heart to stand
    and look at the sun, from its rising in the morning ’till its setting
    at night; at which time, if his heart and his strength have not failed
    him, he is “cut down,” receives the liberal donation of presents (which
    have been thrown into a pile before him during the day), and also the
    name and the style of a doctor, or <em>medicine-man</em>, which lasts
    him, and ensures him respect, through life.</p>

  <p>This most extraordinary and cruel custom I never heard of amongst any
    other tribe, and never saw an instance of it before or after the one I
    have just named. It is a sort of worship, or penance, of great cruelty;
    disgusting and painful to behold, with only one palliating circumstance
    about it, which is, that it is a voluntary torture and of very rare
    occurrence. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span> poor and ignorant, misguided and superstitious man who
    undertakes it, puts his everlasting reputation at stake upon the issue;
    for when he takes his stand, he expects to face the sun and gradually
    turn his body in listless silence, till he sees it go down at night;
    and if he faints and falls, of which there is imminent danger, he loses
    his reputation as a brave or mystery-man, and suffers a signal disgrace
    in the estimation of the tribe, like all men who have the presumption
    to set themselves up for braves or mystery-men, and fail justly to
    sustain the character.</p>

  <p>The Sioux seem to have many modes of worshipping the Great or Good
    Spirit, and also of conciliating the Evil Spirit: they have numerous
    fasts and feasts, and many modes of sacrificing, but yet they seem
    to pay less strict attention to them than the Mandans do, which may
    perhaps be owing in a great measure to the wandering and predatory
    modes of life which they pursue, rendering it difficult to adhere so
    rigidly to the strict form and letter of their customs.</p>

  <p>There had been, a few days before I arrived at this place, a great
    medicine operation held on the prairie, a mile or so back of the
    Fort, and which, of course, I was not lucky enough to see. The poles
    were still standing, and the whole transaction was described to me by
    my friend Mr. Halsey, one of the clerks in the Establishment. From
    the account given of it, it seems to bear some slight resemblance to
    that of the <em>Mandan religious ceremony</em>, but no nearer to it
    than a feeble effort by so ignorant and superstitious a people, to
    copy a custom which they most probably have had no opportunity to see
    themselves, but have endeavoured to imitate from hearsay. They had an
    awning of immense size erected on the prairie which is yet standing,
    made of willow bushes supported by posts, with poles and willow boughs
    laid over; under the centre of which there was a pole set firmly in the
    ground, from which many of the young men had suspended their bodies by
    splints run through the flesh in different parts, the numerous scars of
    which were yet seen bleeding afresh from day to day, amongst the crowds
    that were about me.</p>

  <p>During my stay amongst the Sioux, as I was considered by them to be
    great <em>medicine</em>, I received many pipes and other little things
    from them as presents, given to me in token of respect for me, and
    as assurances of their friendship; and I, being desirous to collect
    and bring from their country every variety of their manufactures, of
    their costumes, their weapons, their pipes, and their mystery-things,
    purchased a great many others, for which, as I was “medicine”
    and a “great white chief!” I was necessarily obliged to pay very
    <em>liberal</em> prices.</p>

  <p>Of the various costumes (of this, as well as of other tribes), that I
    have collected, there will be seen fair and faithful representations in
    the numerous portraits; and of their war-clubs, pipes, &amp;c. I have set
    forth in the following illustrations, a few of the most interesting of
    the very great numbers of those things which I have collected in this
    and other tribes which I have visited.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span></p>

  <p>The luxury of smoking is known to all the North American Indians,
    in their primitive state, and that before they have any knowledge
    of tobacco; which is only introduced amongst them by civilized
    adventurers, who teach them the use and luxury of whiskey at the same
    time.</p>

  <p>In their native state they are excessive smokers, and many of them (I
    would almost venture the assertion), would seem to be smoking one-half
    of their lives. There may be two good reasons for this, the first
    of which is, that the idle and leisure life that the Indian leads,
    (who has no trade or business to follow—no office hours to attend
    to, or profession to learn), induces him to look for occupation and
    amusement in so innocent a luxury, which again further tempts him
    to its excessive use, from its feeble and harmless effects on the
    system. There are many weeds and leaves, and barks of trees, which are
    narcotics, and of spontaneous growth in their countries, which the
    Indians dry and pulverize, and carry in pouches and smoke to great
    excess—and which in several of the languages, when thus prepared, is
    called <i lang="mhq">k’nick k’neck</i>.</p>

  <p>As smoking is a luxury so highly valued by the Indians, they have
    bestowed much pains, and not a little ingenuity, to the construction
    of their pipes. Of these I have procured a collection of several
    hundreds, and in <a href="#i_098"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 98</a>, have given fac-simile outlines of
    a number of the most curious. The bowls of these are generally made of
    the red steatite, or “pipe-stone” (as it is more familiarly called in
    this country), and many of them designed and carved with much taste
    and skill, with figures and groups in <i>alto relievo</i>, standing or
    reclining upon them.</p>

  <p>The red stone of which these pipe bowls are made, is, in my estimation,
    a great curiosity; inasmuch as I am sure it is a variety of steatite
    (if it be steatite), differing from that of any known European
    locality, and also from any locality known in America, other than the
    one from which all these pipes come; and which are all traceable I have
    found to one source; and that source as yet unvisited except by the
    red man who describes it, everywhere, as a place of vast importance to
    the Indians—as given to them by the Great Spirit, for their pipes, and
    strictly forbidden to be used for anything else.</p>

  <p>The source from whence all these pipes come, is, undoubtedly, somewhere
    between this place and the Mississippi River; and as the Indians all
    speak of it as a great <em>medicine</em>-place, I shall certainly lay my
    course to it, ere long, and be able to give the world some account of
    it and its mysteries.</p>

  <p>The Indians shape out the bowls of these pipes from the solid stone,
    which is not quite as hard as marble, with nothing but a knife. The
    stone which is of a cherry red, admits of a beautiful polish, and the
    Indian makes the hole in the bowl of the pipe, by drilling into it a
    hard stick, shaped to the desired size, with a quantity of sharp sand
    and water kept constantly in the hole, subjecting him therefore to a
    very great labour and the necessity of much patience.</p>

  <figure class="illowp75 mt2" id="i_099">
    <div class="plate"><i>65</i></div>

     <figcaption>99</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span></p>

  <p>The shafts or stems of these pipes, as will be seen in <a href="#i_098"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    98</a>, are from two to four feet long, sometimes round, but most
    generally flat; of an inch or two in breadth, and wound half their
    length or more with braids of porcupines’ quills; and often ornamented
    with the beaks and tufts from the wood-pecker’s head, with ermine skins
    and long red hair, dyed from white horse hair or the white buffalo’s
    tail.</p>

  <p>The stems of these pipes will be found to be carved in many ingenious
    forms, and in all cases they are perforated through the centre, quite
    staggering the wits of the enlightened world to <em>guess how</em> the
    holes have been <em>bored</em> through them; until it is simply and
    briefly explained, that the stems are uniformly made of the stalk of
    the young ash, which generally grows straight, and has a small pith
    through the centre, which is easily burned out with a hot wire or a
    piece of hard wood, by a much slower process.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_098"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 98</a>, the pipes marked <i>b</i> are ordinary
    pipes, made and used for the <em>luxury</em> only of smoking; and
    for this purpose, every Indian designs and constructs his own
    pipe. The <em>calumet</em>, or pipe of peace (<a href="#i_098"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 98</a>
    <i>a</i>), ornamented with the war-eagle’s quills, is a sacred
    pipe, and never allowed to be used on any other occasion than that
    of <em>peace-making</em>; when the chief brings it into treaty, and
    unfolding the many bandages which are carefully kept around it—has
    it ready to be mutually smoked by the chiefs, after the terms of
    the treaty are agreed upon, as the means of <em>solemnizing</em> or
    <em>signing</em>, by an illiterate people, who cannot draw up an
    instrument, and sign their names to it, as it is done in the civilized
    world.</p>

  <p>The mode of solemnizing is by passing the sacred stem to each chief,
    who draws one breath of smoke only through it, thereby passing the most
    inviolable pledge that they can possibly give, for the keeping of the
    peace. This sacred pipe is then carefully folded up, and stowed away in
    the chief’s lodge, until a similar occasion calls it out to be used in
    a similar manner.</p>

  <p>There is no custom more uniformly in constant use amongst the poor
    Indians than that of smoking, nor any other more highly valued. His
    pipe is his constant companion through life—his messenger of peace;
    he pledges his friends through its stem and its bowl—and when its
    care-drowning fumes cease to flow, it takes a place with him in his
    solitary grave, with his tomahawk and war-club, companions to his long
    fancied, “mild and beautiful hunting-grounds.”</p>

  <p>The weapons of these people, like their pipes, are numerous, and mostly
    manufactured by themselves. In a former place (<a href="#i_018"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 18</a>) I
    have described a part of these, such as the bows and arrows, lances,
    &amp;c., and they have yet many others, specimens of which I have collected
    from every tribe; and a number of which I have grouped together in
    <a href="#i_099"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 99</a>; consisting of knives, war-clubs, and tomahawks. I
    have here introduced the most general and established forms that are
    in use amongst the different tribes, which are all strictly copied
    from amongst the great variety of these articles to be found in my
    Collection.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>

  <p>The scalping-knives <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, and tomahawks <i>e</i>
    <i>e</i> <i>e</i> <i>e</i> are of civilized manufacture, made expressly
    for Indian use, and carried into the Indian country by thousands
    and tens of thousands, and sold at an enormous price. The scabbards
    of the knives and handles for the tomahawks, the Indians construct
    themselves, according to their own taste, and oftentimes ornament them
    very handsomely. In his rude and unapproached condition, the Indian
    is a stranger to such weapons as these—he works not in the metals;
    and his untutored mind has not been ingenious enough to design or
    execute anything so <em>savage</em> or destructive as these civilized
    <em>refinements on Indian barbarity</em>. In his native simplicity
    he shapes out his rude hatchet from a piece of stone, as in letter
    <i>f</i>, heads his arrows and spears with flints; and his knife is a
    sharpened bone, or the edge of a broken silex. The war-club <i>c</i> is
    also another civilized refinement, with a blade of steel, of eight or
    ten inches in length, and set in a club, studded around and ornamented
    with some hundreds of brass nails.</p>

  <p>Their primitive clubs <i>d</i> are curiously carved in wood, and
    fashioned out with some considerable picturesque form and grace; are
    admirably fitted to the hand, and calculated to deal a deadly blow with
    the spike of iron or bone which is imbedded in the ball or bulb at the
    end.</p>

  <p>Two of the tomahawks that I have named, marked <i>e</i>, are what
    are denominated “pipe-tomahawks,” as the heads of them are formed
    into bowls like a pipe, in which their tobacco is put, and they smoke
    through the handle. These are the most valued of an Indian’s weapons,
    inasmuch as they are a matter of luxury, and useful for cutting his
    fire-wood, &amp;c. in time of peace; and deadly weapons in time of war,
    which they use in the hand, or throw with unerring and deadly aim.</p>

  <p>The scalping-knife <i>b</i> in a beautiful scabbard, which is carried
    under the belt, is the form of knife most generally used in all
    parts of the Indian country, where knives have been introduced. It
    is a common and cheap butcher knife with one edge, manufactured at
    Sheffield, in England, perhaps, for sixpence; and sold to the poor
    Indian in these wild regions for a horse. If I should live to get
    home, and should ever cross the Atlantic with my Collection, a curious
    enigma would be solved for the English people, who may enquire for a
    scalping-knife, when they find that every one in my Collection (and
    hear also, that nearly every one that is to be seen in the Indian
    country, to the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean) bears on its
    blade the impress of G.R., which they will doubtless understand.</p>

  <p>The huge two-edged knife, with its scabbard of a part of the skin of a
    grizzly bear’s head, letter <i>a</i>, is one belonging to the famous
    chief of the Mandans, of whom I have before said much. The manufacture
    of this knife is undoubtedly American; and its shape differs altogether
    from those which are in general use.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>66</i></div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>

  <p>The above weapons, as well as the bow and lance, of which I have before
    spoken, are all carried and used on horseback with great effect. The
    Indians in this country of green fields, all <em>ride</em> for their
    enemies, and also for their game, which is almost invariably killed
    whilst their horses are at full-speed. They are all cruel masters
    for their horses; and in war or the chase goad them on with a heavy
    and cruel whip (<a href="#i_099"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 99</a> <i>g</i>), the handle of which is
    generally made of a large prong of the elk’s horn or of wood, and the
    lashes of rawhide are very heavy; being braided, or twisted, or cut
    into wide straps. These are invariably attached to the wrist of the
    right arm by a tough thong, so that they can be taken up and used at
    any moment, and dropped the next, without being lost.</p>

  <p>During the time that I was engaged in painting my portraits, I was
    occasionally inducing the young men to give me their dances, a great
    variety of which they gave me by being slightly paid; which I was glad
    to do, in order to enable me to study their character and expression
    thoroughly, which I am sure I have done; and I shall take pleasure in
    shewing them to the world when I get back. The dancing is generally
    done by the young men, and considered undignified for the chiefs or
    doctors to join in. Yet so great was my <em>medicine</em>, that chiefs
    and medicine-men turned out and agreed to compliment me with a dance
    (<a href="#i_100"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 100</a>). I looked on with great satisfaction; having been
    assured by the Interpreters and Traders, that this was the highest
    honour they had ever known them to pay to any stranger amongst them.</p>

  <p>In this dance, which I have called “the dance of the chiefs,” for want
    of a more significant title, was given by fifteen or twenty chiefs and
    doctors; many of whom were very old and venerable men. All of them came
    out in their head-dresses of war-eagle quills, with a spear or staff in
    the left hand, and a rattle in the right. It was given in the midst of
    the Sioux village, in front of the head chief’s lodge; and beside the
    medicine-man who beat on the drum, and sang for the dance, there were
    four young women standing in a row, and chanting a sort of chorus for
    the dancers; forming one of the very few instances that I ever have
    met, where the women are allowed to take any part in the dancing, or
    other game or amusement, with the men.</p>

  <p>This dance was a very spirited thing, and pleased me much, as well as
    all the village, who were assembled around to witness what most of them
    never before had seen, their aged and venerable chiefs united in giving
    a dance.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

  <p>As I have introduced the <em>scalping-knife</em> above, it may be well
    for me to give some further account in this place of the custom and the
    mode of taking the scalp; a custom practiced by all the North American
    Indians, which is done when an enemy is killed in battle, by grasping
    the left hand into the hair on the crown of the head, and passing the
    knife around it through the skin, tearing off a piece of the skin with
    the hair, as large as the palm of the hand, or larger, which is dried,
    and often curiously ornamented and preserved, and highly valued as a
    trophy. The scalping is an operation not calculated of itself to take
    life, as it only removes the skin, without injuring the bone of the
    head; and necessarily, to be a genuine scalp, must contain and show the
    crown or centre of the head; that part of the skin which lies directly
    over what the phrenologists call “self-esteem,” where the hair divides
    and radiates from the centre; of which they all profess to be strict
    judges, and able to decide whether an effort has been made to produce
    two or more scalps from one head. Besides taking the scalp, the victor
    generally, if he has time to do it without endangering his own scalp,
    cuts off and brings home the rest of the hair, which his wife will
    divide into a great many small locks, and with them fringe off the
    seams of his shirt and his leggings, as will have been seen in many of
    the illustrations; which also are worn as trophies and ornaments to the
    dress, and then are familiarly called “<em>scalp-locks</em>.” Of these
    there are many dresses in my Collection, which exhibit a continuous row
    from the top of each shoulder, down the arms to the wrists, and down
    the seams of the leggings, from the hips to the feet, rendering them
    a very costly article to buy from the Indian who is not sure that his
    success in his military exploits will ever enable him to replace them.</p>

  <p>The scalp, then, is a patch of the skin taken from the head of an enemy
    killed in battle, and preserved and highly appreciated as the record of
    a death produced by the hand of the individual who possesses it; and
    may oftentimes during his life, be of great service to a man living
    in a community where there is no historian to enrol the names of the
    famous—to record the heroic deeds of the brave, who have gained their
    laurels in mortal combat with their enemies; where it is as lawful
    and as glorious to slay an enemy in battle, as it is in Christian
    communities, and where the poor Indian is bound to keep the record
    himself, or be liable to lose it and the honour, for no one in the
    tribe will keep it for him. As the scalp is taken then as the evidence
    of a death, it will easily be seen, that the Indian has no business or
    inclination to take it from the head of the living; which I venture to
    say is never done in North America, unless it be, as it sometimes has
    happened, where a man falls in the heat of battle, stunned with the
    blow of a weapon or a gunshot, and the Indian, rushing over his body,
    snatches off his scalp, supposing him dead, who afterwards rises from
    the field of battle, and easily recovers from this superficial wound
    of the knife, wearing a bald spot on his head during the remainder
    of his life, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span> which we have frequent occurrences on our Western
    frontiers. The scalp must be from the head of <em>an enemy</em> also, or
    it subjects its possessor to disgrace and infamy who carries it. There
    may be many instances where an Indian is justified in the estimation
    of his tribe in taking the life of one of his own people; and their
    laws are such, as oftentimes make it his imperative duty; and yet no
    circumstances, however aggravating, will justify him or release him
    from the disgrace of taking the scalp.</p>

  <figure class="illowp75 mt2" id="i_101">
    <div class="plate"><i>67</i></div>
    <img src="images/i_101.jpg" alt="" />
     <figcaption>101</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>There is no custom practised by the Indians, for which they are
    more universally condemned, than that of taking the scalp; and, at
    the same time, I think there is some excuse for them, inasmuch as
    it is a general custom of the country, and founded, like many other
    apparently absurd and ridiculous customs of these people, in one of
    the necessities of Indian life, which necessities we are free from in
    the civilized world, and which customs, of course, we need not and do
    not practice. From an ancient custom, “time out of mind,” the warriors
    of these tribes have been in the habit of going to war, expecting to
    take the scalps of their enemies whom they may slay in battle, and all
    eyes of the tribe are upon them, making it their duty to do it; so from
    custom it is every man’s right, and his duty also, to continue and keep
    up a regulation of his society, which it is not in his power as an
    individual, to abolish or correct, if he saw fit to do it.</p>

  <p>One of the principal denunciations against the custom of taking the
    scalp, is on account of its alleged <em>cruelty</em>, which it certainly
    has not; as the cruelty would be in the <em>killing</em>, and not in the
    act of cutting the skin from a man’s head after he is dead. To say the
    most of it, it is a disgusting custom, and I wish I could be quite sure
    that the civilized and Christian world (who kill hundreds, to where the
    poor Indians kill one), do not often treat their <em>enemies dead</em>,
    in equally as indecent and disgusting a manner, as the Indian does by
    taking the scalp.</p>

  <p>If the reader thinks that I am taking too much pains to defend the
    Indians for this, and others of their seemingly abominable customs,
    he will bear it in mind, that I have lived with these people, until I
    have learned the necessities of Indian life in which these customs are
    founded; and also, that I have met with so many acts of kindness and
    hospitality at the hands of the poor Indian, that I feel bound, when I
    can do it, to render what excuse I can for a people, who are dying with
    broken hearts, and never can speak in the civilized world in their own
    defence.</p>

  <p>And even yet, reader, if your education, and your reading of Indian
    cruelties and Indian barbarities—of scalps, and scalping-knives, and
    scalping, should have ossified a corner of your heart against these
    unfortunate people, and would shut out their advocate, I will annoy
    you no longer on this subject, but withdraw, and leave you to cherish
    the very beautiful, humane and parental moral that was carried out by
    the United States and British Governments during the last, and the
    revolutionary wars, when they mutually employed thousands of their
    “<em>Red children</em>,” to aid and to bleed, in fighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span> their battles,
    and paid them, according to contract, so many pounds, shillings and
    pence or so many dollars and cents for every “<em>scalp</em>” of a “red”
    or a “blue coat” they could bring in!</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_101"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 101</a>, there will be seen the principal modes in which
    the scalps are prepared, and several of the uses to which they are
    put. The most usual way of preparing and dressing the scalp is that
    of stretching it on a little hoop at the end of a stick two or three
    feet long (letter <i>a</i>), for the purpose of “dancing it,” as they
    term it; which will be described in the <em>scalp-dance</em>, in a few
    moments. There are many again, which are small, and not “dressed;”
    sometimes not larger than a crown piece (letter <i>c</i>), and hung to
    different parts of the dress. In public shows and parades, they are
    often suspended from the bridle bits or halter when they are paraded
    and carried as trophies (letter <i>b</i>). Sometimes they are cut out,
    as it were into a string, the hair forming a beautiful fringe to line
    the handle of a war-club (letter <i>e</i>). Sometimes they are hung at
    the <em>end</em> of a club (<em>letter d</em>), and at other times, by the
    order of the chief, are hung out, over the wigwams, suspended from a
    pole, which is called the “<em>scalp-pole</em>.” This is often done by
    the chief of a village, in a pleasant day, by his erecting over his
    wigwam a pole with all the scalps that he had taken, arranged upon it
    (letter <i>f</i>); at the sight of which all the chiefs and warriors of
    the tribe, who had taken scalps, “follow suit;” enabling every member
    of the community to stroll about the village on that day and “count
    scalps,” learning thereby the standing of every warrior, which is
    decided in a great degree by the number of scalps they have taken in
    battles with their enemies. Letters <i>g</i>, <i>g</i>, shew the usual
    manner of taking the scalp, and (letter <i>h</i>), exhibits the head of
    a man who had been scalped and recovered from the wound.</p>

  <p>So much for scalps and scalping, of which I shall yet say more, unless
    I should unluckily <em>lose one</em> before I get out of the country.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">In</span> the last letter I gave an account of many of the weapons and other
    manufactures of these wild folks; and as this has been a day of
    <em>packing</em> and <em>casing</em> a great many of these things, which
    I have obtained of the Indians, to add to my <i lang="fr">Musée Indienne</i>,
    I will name a few more, which I have just been handling over; some
    description of which may be necessary for the reader in endeavouring
    to appreciate some of their strange customs and amusements, which I am
    soon to unfold. In <a href="#i_101a"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 101½</a>, letters <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>,
    will be seen the <em>quiver</em> made of the fawn’s skin, and the Sioux
    <em>shield</em> made of the skin of the buffalo’s neck, hardened with
    the glue extracted from the hoofs and joints of the same animal. The
    process of “<em>smoking the shield</em>” is a very curious, as well as
    an important one, in their estimation. For this purpose a young man
    about to construct him a shield, digs a hole of two feet in depth, in
    the ground, and as large in diameter as he designs to make his shield.
    In this he builds a fire, and over it, a few inches higher than the
    ground, he stretches the raw hide horizontally over the fire, with
    little pegs driven through holes made near the edges of the skin. This
    skin is at first, twice as large as the size of the required shield;
    but having got his particular and best friends (who are invited on
    the occasion,) into a ring, to dance and sing around it, and solicit
    the Great Spirit to instil into it the power to protect him harmless
    against his enemies, he spreads over it the glue, which is rubbed and
    dried in, as the skin is heated; and a second busily drives other and
    other pegs, inside of those in the ground, as they are gradually giving
    way and being pulled up by the contraction of the skin. By this curious
    process, which is most dexterously done, the skin is kept tight whilst
    it contracts to one-half of its size, taking up the glue and increasing
    in thickness until it is rendered as thick and hard as required (and
    his friends have pleaded long enough to make it arrow, and almost ball
    proof), when the dance ceases, and the fire is put out. When it is
    cooled and cut into the shape that he desires, it is often painted with
    his <em>medicine</em> or <em>totem</em> upon it, the figure of an eagle,
    an owl, a buffalo or other animal, as the case may be, which he trusts
    will guard and protect him from harm; it is then fringed with eagles’
    quills, or other ornaments he may have chosen, and <em>slung</em> with a
    broad leather strap that crosses his breast. These shields are carried
    by all the warriors in these regions, for their protection in battles,
    which are almost invariably fought from their horses’ backs.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

  <p>Of <em>pipes</em>, and the custom of smoking, I have already spoken; and
    I then said, that the Indians use several substitutes for tobacco,
    which they call <i>K’nick K’neck</i>. For the carrying of this
    delicious weed or bark, and preserving its flavour, the women construct
    very curious pouches of otter, or beaver, or other skins (letters
    <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>,), which are ingeniously ornamented with
    porcupine quills and beads, and generally carried hanging across the
    left arm, containing a quantity of the precious <em>narcotic</em>, with
    flint and steel, and spunk, for lighting the pipe.</p>

  <p>The <em>musical instruments</em> used amongst these people are few, and
    exceedingly rude and imperfect, consisting chiefly of rattles, drums,
    whistles, and lutes, all of which are used in the different tribes.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_101a"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 101½</a> (letters <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>,) will be seen
    the <em>rattles</em> (or She-she-quois) most generally used, made of
    rawhide, which becomes very hard when dry, and charged with pebbles
    or something of the kind, which produce a shrill noise to mark the
    time in their dances and songs. Their <em>drums</em> (letters <i>e</i>,
    <i>e</i>,) are made in a very rude manner, oftentimes with a mere
    piece of rawhide stretched over a hoop, very much in the shape of a
    tambourin; and at other times are made in the form of a keg, with a
    head of rawhide at each end; on these they beat with a drum-stick,
    which oftentimes itself is a rattle, the bulb or head of it being made
    of rawhide and filled with pebbles. In other instances the stick has,
    at its end, a little hoop wound and covered with buckskin, to soften
    the sound; with which they beat on the drum with great violence, as
    the chief and <em>heel-inspiring</em> sound for all their dances, and
    also as an accompaniment for their numerous and never-ending songs of
    amusement, of thanksgiving, and <em>medicine</em> or <em>metai</em>. The
    <em>mystery whistle</em>, (letter <i>f</i>,) is another instrument of
    their invention, and very ingeniously made, the sound being produced
    on a principle entirely different from that of any wind instrument
    known in civilized inventions; and the notes produced on it, by the
    sleight or trick of an Indian boy, in so simple and successful a
    manner, as to baffle entirely all civilized ingenuity, even when it
    is seen to be played. An Indian boy would stand and blow his notes on
    this repeatedly, for hundreds of white men who might be lookers-on, not
    one of whom could make the least noise on it, even by practising with
    it for hours. When I first saw this curious exhibition, I was charmed
    with the peculiar sweetness of its harmonic sounds, and completely
    perplexed, (as hundreds of white men have no doubt been before me, to
    the great amusement and satisfaction of the women and children,) as to
    the mode in which the sound was produced, even though it was repeatedly
    played immediately before my eyes, and handed to me for my vain and
    amusing endeavours. The sounds of this little simple toy are liquid and
    sweet beyond description; and, though here only given in harmonics,
    I am inclined to think, might, by some ingenious musician or musical
    instrument-maker, be modulated and converted into something very
    pleasing.</p>

  <p>The <em>War-whistle</em> (letter <i>h</i>,) is a well known and valued
    little instrument,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span> of six or nine inches in length, invariably made
    of the bone of the deer or turkey’s leg, and generally ornamented with
    porcupine quills of different colours which are wound around it. A
    chief or leader carries this to battle with him, suspended generally
    from his neck, and worn under his dress. This little instrument has
    but two notes, which are produced by blowing in the ends of it. The
    note produced in one end, being much more shrill than the other, gives
    the signal for battle, whilst the other sounds a retreat; a thing that
    is distinctly heard and understood by every man, even in the heat and
    noise of battle, where all are barking and yelling as loud as possible,
    and of course unable to hear the commands of their leader.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>69</i></div>
  <figure id="i_102">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_102.jpg" alt="" />
     <figcaption>102</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>There is yet another wind instrument which I have added to my
    Collection, and from its appearance would seem to have been borrowed,
    in part, from the civilized world (letter <i>g</i>). This is what is
    often on the frontier called a “<em>deer-skin flute</em>,” a “Winnebago
    courting flute,” a “tsal-eet-quash-to,” &amp;c.; it is perforated with
    holes for the fingers, sometimes for six, at others for four, and in
    some instances for three only, having only so many notes with their
    octaves. These notes are very irregularly graduated, showing clearly
    that they have very little taste or ear for melody. These instruments
    are blown in the end, and the sound produced much on the principle of a
    whistle.</p>

  <p>In the vicinity of the Upper Mississippi, I often and familiarly heard
    this instrument, called the Winnebago courting flute; and was credibly
    informed by traders and others in those regions, that the young men
    of that tribe meet with signal success, oftentimes, in wooing their
    sweethearts with its simple notes, which they blow for hours together,
    and from day to day, from the bank of some stream—some favourite rock
    or log on which they are seated, near to the wigwam which contains the
    object of their tender passion; until her soul is touched, and she
    responds by some welcome signal, that she is ready to repay the young
    <em>Orpheus</em> for his pains, with the gift of her hand and her heart.
    How true these representations may have been made, I cannot say, but
    there certainly must have been some ground for the present cognomen by
    which it is known in that country.</p>

  <p>From these rude and exceedingly defective instruments, it will at once
    be seen, that music has made but little progress with these people; and
    the same fact will be still more clearly proved, to those who have an
    opportunity to hear their vocal exhibitions, which are daily and almost
    hourly serenading the ears of the traveller through their country.</p>

  <p>Dancing is one of the principal and most frequent amusements of all
    the tribes of Indians in America; and, in all of these, both vocal and
    instrumental music are introduced. These dances consist in about four
    different steps, which constitute all the different varieties: but the
    figures and forms of these scenes are very numerous, and produced by
    the most violent jumps and contortions, accompanied with the song and
    beats of the drum, which are given in exact time with their motions.
    It has been said by some travellers, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span> the Indian has neither
    harmony or melody in his music, but I am unwilling to subscribe to such
    an assertion; although I grant, that for the most part of their vocal
    exercises, there is a total absence of what the musical world would
    call melody; their songs being made up chiefly of a sort of violent
    chaunt of harsh and jarring gutturals, of yelps and barks, and screams,
    which are given out in perfect time, not only with “method (but with
    harmony) in their madness.” There are times too, as every traveller
    of the Indian country will attest, if he will recall them to his
    recollection, when the Indian lays down by his fire-side with his drum
    in his hand, which he lightly and almost imperceptibly touches over, as
    he accompanies it with his stifled voice of dulcet sounds that might
    come from the most tender and delicate female.</p>

  <p>These quiet and tender songs are very different from those which are
    sung at their dances, in full chorus and violent gesticulation; and
    many of them seem to be quite rich in plaintive expression and melody,
    though barren of change and variety.</p>

  <p><em>Dancing</em>, I have before said, is one of the principal and most
    valued amusements of the Indians, and much more frequently practised by
    them than by any civilized society; inasmuch as it enters into their
    forms of worship, and is often their mode of appealing to the Great
    Spirit—of paying their usual devotions to their <em>medicine</em>—and of
    honouring and entertaining strangers of distinction in their country.</p>

  <p>Instead of the “giddy maze” of the quadrille or the country dance,
    enlivened by the cheering smiles and graces of silkened beauty, the
    Indian performs his rounds with jumps, and starts, and yells, much to
    the satisfaction of his own exclusive self, and infinite amusement
    of the gentler sex, who are always lookers on, but seldom allowed so
    great a pleasure, or so signal an honour, as that of joining with
    their lords in this or any other entertainment. Whilst staying with
    these people on my way up the river, I was repeatedly honoured with
    the dance, and I as often hired them to give them, or went to overlook
    where they were performing them at their own pleasure, in pursuance
    of their peculiar customs, or for their own amusement, that I might
    study and correctly herald them to future ages. I saw so many of their
    different varieties of dances amongst the Sioux, that I should almost
    be disposed to denominate them the “<em>dancing Indians</em>.” It would
    actually seem as if they had dances for every thing. And in so large a
    village, there was scarcely an hour in any day or night, but what the
    beat of the drum could somewhere be heard. These dances are almost as
    various and different in their character as they are numerous—some of
    them so exceedingly grotesque and laughable, as to keep the bystanders
    in an irresistible roar of laughter—others are calculated to excite his
    pity, and forcibly appeal to his sympathies, whilst others disgust,
    and yet others terrify and alarm him with their frightful threats and
    contortions.</p>

  <p>All the world have heard of the “<em>bear-dance</em>,” though I doubt
    whether more than a very small proportion have ever seen it; here it
    is (<a href="#i_102"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 102</a>).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span> The Sioux, like all the others of these
    western tribes, are fond of bear’s meat, and must have good stores
    of the “bear’s-grease” laid in, to oil their long and glossy locks,
    as well as the surface of their bodies. And they all like the fine
    pleasure of a bear hunt, and also a participation in the bear dance,
    which is given several days in succession, previous to their starting
    out, and in which they all join in a song to the <em>Bear Spirit</em>;
    which they think holds somewhere an invisible existence, and must be
    consulted and conciliated before they can enter upon their excursion
    with any prospect of success. For this grotesque and amusing scene,
    one of the chief medicine-men, placed over his body the entire skin
    of a bear, with a war-eagle’s quill on his head, taking the lead in
    the dance, and looking through the skin which formed a masque that
    hung over his face. Many others in the dance wore masques on their
    faces, made of the skin from the bear’s head; and all, with the motions
    of their hands, closely imitated the movements of that animal; some
    representing its motion in running, and others the peculiar attitude
    and hanging of the paws, when it is sitting up on its hind feet,
    and looking out for the approach of an enemy. This grotesque and
    amusing masquerade oftentimes is continued at intervals, for several
    days previous to the starting of a party on the bear hunt, who would
    scarcely count upon a tolerable prospect of success, without a strict
    adherence to this most important and indispensible form!</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>70</i></div>
  <figure id="i_103">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_103.jpg" alt="" />
     <figcaption>103</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Dancing is done here too, as it is oftentimes done in the enlightened
    world, to get favours—to buy the world’s goods; and in both countries
    danced with about equal merit, except that the Indian has surpassed
    us in honesty by christening it in his own country, the “<em>beggar’s
    dance</em>.” This spirited dance (<a href="#i_103"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 103</a>), was given, not by
    a set of <em>beggars</em> though, literally speaking, but by the first
    and most independent young men in the tribe, beautifully dressed,
    (<i>i. e.</i> not dressed at all, except with their breech clouts or
    <em>kelts</em>, made of eagles’ and ravens’ quills,) with their lances,
    and pipes, and rattles in their hands, and a medicine-man beating the
    drum, and joining in the song at the highest key of his voice. In this
    dance every one sings as loud as he can halloo; uniting his voice with
    the others, in an appeal to the Great Spirit, to open the hearts of
    the bystanders to give to the poor, and not to themselves; assuring
    them that the Great Spirit will be kind to those who are kind to the
    helpless and poor.</p>

  <p>Of <em>scalps</em>, and of the modes and objects of scalping, I have
    before spoken; and I therein stated, “that most of the scalps were
    stretched on little hoops for the purpose of being used in the
    scalp-dance, of which I shall say more at a future time.”</p>

  <p>The <em>Scalp-dance</em> (<a href="#i_104"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 104</a>) is given as a celebration
    of a victory; and amongst this tribe, as I learned whilst residing
    with them, danced in the night, by the light of their torches, and
    just before retiring to bed. When a war party returns from a war
    excursion, bringing home with them the scalps of their enemies, they
    generally “dance them” for fifteen nights in succession,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span> vaunting
    forth the most extravagant boasts of their wonderful prowess in war,
    whilst they brandish their war weapons in their hands. A number of
    young women are selected to aid (though they do not actually join in
    the dance), by stepping into the centre of the ring, and holding up the
    scalps that have been recently taken, whilst the warriors dance (or
    rather <em>jump</em>), around in a circle, brandishing their weapons,
    and barking and yelping in the most frightful manner, all jumping on
    both feet at a time, with a simultaneous stamp, and blow, and thrust
    of their weapons; with which it would seem as if they were actually
    cutting and carving each other to pieces. During these frantic leaps,
    and yelps, and thrusts, every man distorts his face to the utmost of
    his muscles, darting about his glaring eye-balls and snapping his
    teeth, as if he were in the heat (and actually breathing through his
    inflated nostrils the very hissing death) of battle! No description
    that can be written, could ever convey more than a feeble outline of
    the frightful effects of these scenes enacted in the dead and darkness
    of night, under the glaring light of their blazing flambeaux; nor could
    all the years allotted to mortal man, in the least obliterate or deface
    the vivid impress that one scene of this kind would leave upon his
    memory.</p>

  <p>The precise object for which the scalp is taken, is one which is
    definitely understood, and has already been explained; but the motive
    (or motives) for which this strict ceremony is so scrupulously held
    by all the American tribes, over the scalp of an enemy, is a subject,
    as yet not satisfactorily settled in my mind. There is no doubt, but
    one great object in these exhibitions is public exultation; yet there
    are several conclusive evidences, that there are other and essential
    motives for thus formally and strictly displaying the scalp. Amongst
    some of the tribes, it is the custom to bury the scalps after they
    have gone through this series of public exhibitions; which may in a
    measure have been held for the purpose of giving them notoriety, and of
    awarding public credit to the persons who obtained them, and now, from
    a custom of the tribe, are obliged to part with them. The great respect
    which seems to be paid to them whilst they use them, as well as the
    pitying and mournful song which they howl to the <em>manes</em> of their
    unfortunate victims; as well as the precise care and solemnity with
    which they afterwards bury the scalps, sufficiently convince me that
    they have a superstitious dread of the spirits of their slain enemies,
    and many conciliatory offices to perform, to ensure their own peace;
    one of which is the ceremony above described.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">In</span> former Letters I have given some account of the <em>Bisons</em>,
    or (as they are more familiarly denominated in this country)
    <em>Buffaloes</em>, which inhabit these regions in numerous herds; and of
    which I must say yet a little more.</p>

  <p>These noble animals of the ox species, and which have been so well
    described in our books on Natural History, are a subject of curious
    interest and great importance in this vast wilderness; rendered
    peculiarly so at this time, like the history of the poor savage; and
    from the same consideration, that they are rapidly wasting away at the
    approach of civilized man—and like him and his character, in a very few
    years, to live only in books or on canvass.</p>

  <p>The word buffalo is undoubtedly most incorrectly applied to these
    animals, and I can scarcely tell why they have been so called; for
    they bear just about as much resemblance to the Eastern buffalo, as
    they do to a zebra or to a common ox. How nearly they may approach to
    the bison of Europe, which I never have had an opportunity to see, and
    which, I am inclined to think, is now nearly extinct, I am unable to
    say; yet if I were to judge from the numerous engravings I have seen
    of those animals, and descriptions I have read of them, I should be
    inclined to think, there was yet a wide difference between the bison
    of the American prairies, and those in the North of Europe and Asia.
    The American bison, or (as I shall hereafter call it) buffalo, is the
    largest of the ruminating animals that is now living in America; and
    seems to have been spread over the plains of this vast country, by the
    Great Spirit, for the use and subsistence of the red men, who live
    almost exclusively on their flesh, and clothe themselves with their
    skins. The reader, by referring back to <span class="smcap">plates</span> <a href="#i_007">7</a> and <a href="#i_008">8</a>, in the
    beginning of this Work, will see faithful traces of the male and female
    of this huge animal, in their proud and free state of nature, grazing
    on the plains of the country to which they appropriately belong. Their
    colour is a dark brown, but changing very much as the season varies
    from warm to cold; their hair or fur, from its great length in the
    winter and spring, and exposure to the weather, turning quite light,
    and almost to a jet black, when the winter coat is shed off, and a new
    growth is shooting out.</p>

  <p>The buffalo bull often grows to the enormous weight of 2000 pounds, and
    shakes a long and shaggy black mane, that falls in great profusion and
    <em>confusion</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span> over his head and shoulders; and oftentimes falling
    down quite to the ground. The horns are short, but very large, and have
    but one turn, <i>i. e.</i> they are a simple arch, without the least
    approach to a spiral form, like those of the common ox, or of the goat
    species.</p>

  <p>The female is much smaller than the male, and always distinguishable
    by the peculiar shape of the horns, which are much smaller and more
    crooked, turning their points more in towards the centre of the
    forehead.</p>

  <p>One of the most remarkable characteristics of the buffalo, is the
    peculiar formation and expression of the eye, the ball of which is
    very large and white, and the iris jet black. The lids of the eye seem
    always to be strained quite open, and the ball rolling forward and
    down; so that a considerable part of the iris is hidden behind the
    lower lid, while the pure white of the eyeball glares out over it in an
    arch, in the shape of a moon at the end of its first quarter.</p>

  <p>These animals are, truly speaking, gregarious, but not migratory—they
    graze in immense and almost incredible numbers at times, and roam about
    and over vast tracts of country, from East to West, and from West to
    East, as often as from North to South; which has often been supposed
    they naturally and habitually did to accommodate themselves to the
    temperature of the climate in the different latitudes. The limits
    within which they are found in America, are from the 30th to the 55th
    degrees of North latitude; and their extent from East to West, which is
    from the border of our extreme Western frontier limits, to the Western
    verge of the Rocky Mountains, is defined by quite different causes,
    than those which the degrees of temperature have prescribed to them
    on the North and the South. Within these 25 degrees of latitude, the
    buffaloes seem to flourish, and get their living without the necessity
    of evading the rigour of the climate, for which Nature seems most
    wisely to have prepared them by the greater or less profusion of fur,
    with which she has clothed them.</p>

  <p>It is very evident that, as high North as Lake Winnepeg, seven or eight
    hundred miles North of this, the buffalo subsists itself through the
    severest winters; getting its food chiefly by browsing amongst the
    timber, and by pawing through the snow, for a bite at the grass, which
    in those regions is frozen up very suddenly in the beginning of the
    winter, with all its juices in it, and consequently furnishes very
    nutritious and efficient food; and often, if not generally, supporting
    the animal in better flesh during these difficult seasons of their
    lives, than they are found to be in, in the 30th degree of latitude,
    upon the borders of Mexico, where the severity of winter is not known,
    but during a long and tedious autumn, the herbage, under the influence
    of a burning sun, is gradually dried away to a mere husk, and its
    nutriment gone, leaving these poor creatures, even in the dead of
    winter, to bask in the warmth of a genial sun, without the benefit of a
    green or juicy thing to bite at.</p>

  <p>The place from which I am now writing, may be said to be the very heart
    or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span> nucleus of the buffalo country, about equi-distant between the two
    extremes; and of course, the most congenial temperature for them to
    flourish in. The finest animals that graze on the prairies are to be
    found in this latitude; and I am sure I never could send from a better
    source, some further account of the death and destruction that is dealt
    among these noble animals, and hurrying on their final extinction.</p>

  <p>The Sioux are a bold and desperate set of horsemen, and great hunters;
    and in the heart of their country is one of the most extensive
    assortments of goods, of whiskey, and other saleable commodities, as
    well as a party of the most indefatigable men, who are constantly
    calling for every robe that can be stripped from these animals’ backs.</p>

  <p>These are the causes which lead so directly to their rapid destruction;
    and which open to the view of the traveller so freshly, so vividly, and
    so familiarly, the scenes of archery—of lancing, and of death-dealing,
    that belong peculiarly to this wild and shorn country.</p>

  <p>The almost countless herds of these animals that are sometimes met with
    on these prairies, have been often spoken of by other writers, and may
    yet be seen by any traveller who will take the pains to visit these
    regions. The “<em>running season</em>,” which is in August and September,
    is the time when they congregate into such masses in some places, as
    literally to blacken the prairies for miles together. It is no uncommon
    thing at this season, at these gatherings, to see several thousands
    in a mass, eddying and wheeling about under a cloud of dust, which
    is raised by the bulls as they are pawing in the dirt, or engaged in
    desperate combats, as they constantly are, plunging and butting at each
    other in the most furious manner (<a href="#i_105"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 105</a>). In these scenes,
    the males are continually following the females, and the whole mass are
    in constant motion; and all bellowing (or “roaring”) in deep and hollow
    sounds; which, mingled altogether, appear, at the distance of a mile or
    two, like the sound of distant thunder.</p>

  <p>During the season whilst they are congregated together in these dense
    and confused masses, the remainder of the country around for many
    miles, becomes entirely vacated; and the traveller may spend many a
    toilsome day, and many a hungry night, without being cheered by the
    sight of one; where, if he retraces his steps a few weeks after, he
    will find them dispersed, and grazing quietly in little families and
    flocks, and equally stocking the whole country. Of these quiet little
    herds, a fair representation will be seen in <a href="#i_106"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 106</a>, where
    some are grazing, others at play, or lying down, and others indulging
    in their “wallows.” “A bull in his wallow” is a frequent saying in this
    country; and has a very significant meaning with those who have ever
    seen a buffalo bull performing <em>ablution</em>, or rather endeavouring
    to cool his heated sides, by tumbling about in a mud puddle.</p>

  <p>In the heat of summer, these huge animals, which, no doubt, suffer very
    much with the great profusion of their long and shaggy hair or fur,
    often graze on the low grounds in the prairies, where there is a little
    stagnant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span> water lying amongst the grass, and the ground underneath
    being saturated with it, is soft, into which the enormous bull, lowered
    down upon one knee, will plunge his horns, and at last his head,
    driving up the earth, and soon making an excavation in the ground, into
    which the water filters from amongst the grass, forming for him in a
    few moments, a cool and comfortable bath, into which he plunges like a
    hog in his mire.</p>

  <p>In this <em>delectable</em> laver, he throws himself flat upon his side,
    and forcing himself violently around, with his horns and his huge hump
    on his shoulders presented to the sides, he ploughs up the ground by
    his rotary motion, sinking himself deeper and deeper in the ground,
    continually enlarging his pool, in which he at length becomes nearly
    immersed; and the water and mud about him mixed into a complete mortar,
    which changes his colour, and drips in streams from every part of him
    as he rises up upon his feet, a hideous monster of mud and ugliness,
    too frightful and too eccentric to be described!</p>

  <p>It is generally the leader of the herd that takes upon him to make
    this excavation; and if not (but another one opens the ground), the
    leader (who is conqueror) marches forward, and driving the other from
    it plunges himself into it; and having cooled his sides, and changed
    his colour to a walking mass of mud and mortar; he stands in the pool
    until inclination induces him to step out, and give place to the next
    in command, who stands ready; and another, and another, who advance
    forward in their turns, to enjoy the luxury of the wallow; until the
    whole band (sometimes an hundred or more) will pass through it in turn;
    each one throwing his body around in a similar manner; and each one
    adding a little to the dimensions of the pool, while he carries away in
    his hair an equal share of the clay, which dries to a grey or whitish
    colour, and gradually falls off. By this operation, which is done,
    perhaps, in the space of half an hour, a circular excavation of fifteen
    or twenty feet in diameter, and two feet in depth, is completed, and
    left for the water to run into, which soon fills it to the level of the
    ground.</p>

  <p>To these sinks, the waters lying on the surface of the prairies, are
    continually draining, and in them lodging their vegetable deposits;
    which, after a lapse of years, fill them up to the surface with a rich
    soil, which throws up an unusual growth of grass and herbage; forming
    conspicuous circles which arrest the eye of the traveller, and are
    calculated to excite his surprise for ages to come.</p>

  <p>Many travellers who have penetrated not quite far enough into the
    Western country to see the habits of these animals, and the manner
    in which these <em>mysterious</em> circles are made; but who have seen
    the prairies strewed with their bleached bones, and have beheld
    these strange circles, which often occur in groups, and of different
    sizes—have come home with beautiful and ingenious theories (which
    <em>must needs be made</em>), for the origin of these singular and
    unaccountable appearances, which, for want of a rational<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span> theory,
    have generally been attributed to <em>fairy feet</em>, and gained the
    appellation of “<em>fairy circles</em>.”</p>

  <p>Many travellers, again, have supposed that these rings were produced
    by the dances of the Indians, which are oftentimes (and in fact
    most generally) performed in a circle; yet a moment’s consideration
    disproves such a probability, inasmuch as the Indians always select the
    ground for their dancing near the sites of their villages, and that
    always on a dry and hard foundation; when these “fairy circles” are
    uniformly found to be on low and wet ground.</p>

  <p>As my visit to these parts of the “<em>Great Far West</em>” has brought
    me into the heart of the buffalo country, where I have had abundant
    opportunities of seeing this noble animal in all its phases—its habits
    of life, and every mode of its death; I shall take the liberty of being
    yet a little more particular, and of rendering some further accounts of
    scenes which I have witnessed in following out my sporting propensities
    in these singular regions.</p>

  <p>The chief hunting amusement of the Indians in these parts consists in
    the chase of the buffalo, which is almost invariably done on horseback,
    with bow and lance. In this exercise, which is highly prized by them,
    as one of their most valued amusements, as well as for the principal
    mode of procuring meat for their subsistence, they become exceedingly
    expert; and are able to slay these huge animals with apparent ease.</p>

  <p>The Indians in these parts are all mounted on small, but serviceable
    horses, which are caught by them on the prairies, where they are often
    running wild in numerous bands. The Indian, then, mounted on his little
    wild horse, which has been through some years of training, dashes off
    at full speed amongst the herds of buffaloes, elks, or even antelopes,
    and deals his deadly arrows to their hearts from his horse’s back. The
    horse is the fleetest animal of the prairie, and easily brings his
    rider alongside of his game, which falls a certain prey to his deadly
    shafts, at the distance of a few paces.</p>

  <p>In the chase of the buffalo, or other animal, the Indian generally
    “strips” himself and his horse, by throwing off his shield and quiver,
    and every part of his dress, which might be an encumbrance to him in
    running; grasping his bow in his left hand, with five or six arrows
    drawn from his quiver, and ready for instant use. In his right hand (or
    attached to the wrist) is a heavy whip, which he uses without mercy,
    and forces his horse alongside of his game at the swiftest speed.</p>

  <p>These horses are so trained, that the Indian has little use for the
    rein, which hangs on the neck, whilst the horse approaches the animal
    on the right side (<a href="#i_107"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 107</a>), giving his rider the chance
    to throw his arrow to the left; which he does at the instant when the
    horse is passing—bringing him opposite to the heart, which receives the
    deadly weapon “to the feather.” When pursuing a large herd, the Indian
    generally rides close in the rear, until he selects the animal he
    wishes to kill, which he separates from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span> throng as soon as he can,
    by dashing his horse between it and the herd, and forcing it off by
    itself; where he can approach it without the danger of being trampled
    to death, to which he is often liable by too closely escorting the
    multitude.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_107"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 107</a>, I have fairly represented the mode of
    <em>approaching</em>, at the instant the arrow is to be thrown; and the
    striking disparity between the size of a huge bull of 2000 pounds
    weight, and the Indian horse, which, it will be borne in mind, is but a
    pony.</p>

  <p>No bridle whatever is used in this country by the Indians, as they have
    no knowledge of a bit. A short halter, however, which answers in place
    of a bridle, is in general use; of which they usually form a noose
    around the under jaw of the horse, by which they get great power over
    the animal; and which they use generally to <em>stop</em> rather than
    <em>guide</em> the horse. This halter is called by the French Traders in
    the country, <i lang="fr">l’arrêt</i>, the stop, and has great power in arresting
    the speed of a horse; though it is extremely dangerous to use too
    freely as a guide, interfering too much with the freedom of his limbs,
    for the certainty of his feet and security of his rider.</p>

  <p>When the Indian then has directed the course of his steed to the animal
    which he has selected, the training of the horse is such, that it knows
    the object of its rider’s selection, and exerts every muscle to give it
    close company; while the halter lies loose and untouched upon its neck,
    and the rider leans quite forward, and off from the side of his horse,
    with his bow drawn, and ready for the deadly shot, which is given
    at the instant he is opposite to the animal’s body. The horse being
    instinctively afraid of the animal (though he generally brings his
    rider within the reach of the end of his bow), keeps his eye strained
    upon the furious enemy he is so closely encountering; and the moment
    he has approached to the nearest distance required, and has passed the
    animal, whether the shot is given or not, he gradually sheers off, to
    prevent coming on to the horns of the infuriated beast, which often
    are instantly turned, and presented for the fatal reception of its
    too familiar attendant. These frightful collisions often take place,
    notwithstanding the sagacity of the horse, and the caution of its
    rider; for in these extraordinary (and inexpressible) exhilarations of
    chase, which seem to drown the prudence alike, of instinct and reason,
    both horse and rider often seem rushing on to destruction, as if it
    were mere pastime and amusement.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

  <p>I have always counted myself a prudent man, yet I have often
    <em>waked</em> (as it were) out of the delirium of the chase (into which
    I had fallen, as into an agitated sleep, and through which I had passed
    as through a delightful dream), where to have died would have been but
    to have remained, riding on, without a struggle or a pang.</p>

  <p>In some of these, too, I have arisen from the prairie, covered with
    dirt and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>blood, having severed company with gun and horse, the one
    lying some twenty or thirty feet from me with a broken stalk, and the
    other coolly brousing on the grass at half a mile distance, without
    man, and without other beast remaining in sight.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>73</i></div>

  <p>For the novice in these scenes there is much danger of his limbs and
    his life, and he finds it a hard and a desperate struggle that brings
    him in at <em>the death</em> of these huge monsters, except where it has
    been produced by hands that have acquired more sleight and tact than
    his own.</p>

  <p>With the Indian, who has made this the every day sport and amusement of
    his life, there is less difficulty and less danger; he rides without
    “losing his breath,” and his unagitated hand deals <em>certainty</em> in
    its deadly blows.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_108"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 108</a>, I have represented a party of Indians in chase
    of a herd some of whom are pursuing with lance and others with bows and
    arrows. The group in the foreground shews the attitude at the instant
    after the arrow has been thrown and driven to the heart; the Indian at
    full speed, and the <em>laso</em> dragging behind his horse’s heels. The
    laso is a long thong of rawhide, of ten or fifteen yards in length,
    made of several braids or twists, and used chiefly to catch the wild
    horse, which is done by throwing over their necks a noose which is made
    at the end of the <em>laso</em>, with which they are “choked down.” In
    running the buffaloes, or in time of war, the <em>laso</em> drags on the
    ground at the horse’s feet, and sometimes several rods behind, so that
    if a man is dismounted, which is often the case, by the tripping or
    stumbling of the horse, he has the power of grasping to the laso, and
    by stubbornly holding on to it, of stopping and securing his horse, on
    whose back he is instantly replaced, and continuing on in the chase.</p>

  <p>In the dead of the winters, which are very long and severely cold in
    this country, where horses cannot be brought into the chase with any
    avail, the Indian runs upon the surface of the snow by the aid of his
    snow shoes, which buoy him up, while the great weight of the buffaloes,
    sinks them down to the middle of their sides, and completely stopping
    their progress, ensures them certain and easy victims to the bow or
    lance of their pursuers, as in <a href="#i_109"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 109</a>. The snow in these
    regions often lies during the winter, to the depth of three and four
    feet, being blown away from the tops and sides of the hills in many
    places, which are left bare for the buffaloes to graze upon, whilst
    it is drifted in the hollows and ravines to a very great depth, and
    rendered almost entirely impassable to these huge animals, which, when
    closely pursued by their enemies, endeavour to plunge through it,
    but are soon wedged in and almost unable to move, where they fall an
    easy prey to the Indian, who runs up lightly upon his snow shoes and
    drives his lance to their hearts. The skins are then stripped off, to
    be sold to the Fur Traders, and the carcasses left to be devoured by
    the wolves. This is the season in which the greatest number of these
    animals are destroyed for their robes—they are most easily killed at
    this time, and their hair or fur being longer and more abundant, gives
    greater value to the robe.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

  <p>The Indians generally kill and dry meat enough in the fall, when it
    is fat and juicy, to last them through the winter; so that they have
    little other object for this unlimited slaughter, amid the drifts
    of snow, than that of procuring their robes for traffic with their
    Traders. The snow shoes are made in a great many forms, of two and
    three feet in length, and one foot or more in width, of a hoop or
    hoops bent around for the frame, with a netting or web woven across
    with strings of rawhide, on which the feet rest, and to which they are
    fastened with straps somewhat like a skate.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> With these the Indian
    will glide over the snow with astonishing quickness, without sinking
    down, or scarcely leaving his track where he has gone.</p>

  <p>The poor buffaloes have their enemy <em>man</em>, besetting and beseiging
    them at all times of the year, and in all the modes that man in his
    superior wisdom has been able to devise for their destruction. They
    struggle in vain to evade his deadly shafts, when he dashes amongst
    them over the plains on his wild horse—they plunge into the snow-drifts
    where they yield themselves an easy prey to their destroyers, and they
    also stand unwittingly and behold him, unsuspected under the skin of
    a white wolf, insinuating himself and his fatal weapons into close
    company, when they are peaceably grazing on the level prairies, and
    shot down before they are aware of their danger (<a href="#i_110"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 110</a>).</p>

  <p>There are several varieties of the wolf species in this country, the
    most formidable and most numerous of which are white, often sneaking
    about in gangs or families of fifty or sixty in numbers, appearing in
    distance, on the green prairies like nothing but a flock of sheep.
    Many of these animals grow to a very great size, being I should think,
    quite a match for the largest Newfoundland dog. At present, whilst the
    buffaloes are so abundant, and these ferocious animals are glutted
    with the buffalo’s flesh, they are harmless, and everywhere sneak away
    from man’s presence; which I scarcely think will be the case after
    the buffaloes are all gone, and they are left, as they must be, with
    scarcely anything to eat. They always are seen following about in the
    vicinity of herds of buffaloes and stand ready to pick the bones of
    those that the hunters leave on the ground, or to overtake and devour
    those that are wounded, which fall an easy prey to them. While the herd
    of buffaloes are together, they seem to have little dread of the wolf,
    and allow them to come in close company with them. The Indian then has
    taken advantage of this fact, and often places himself under the skin
    of this animal, and crawls for half a mile or more on his hands and
    knees, until he approaches within a few rods of the unsuspecting group,
    and easily shoots down the fattest of the throng.</p>

  <p>The buffalo is a very timid animal, and shuns the vicinity of man
    with the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>keenest sagacity; yet, when overtaken, and harassed or
    wounded, turns upon its assailants with the utmost fury, who have only
    to seek safety in flight. In their desperate resistance the finest
    horses are often destroyed; but the Indian, with his superior sagacity
    and dexterity, generally finds some effective mode of escape, as in
    <a href="#i_111"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 111</a>.</p>

  <p>During the season of the year whilst the calves are young, the male
    seems to stroll about by the side of the dam, as if for the purpose
    of protecting the young, at which time it is exceedingly hazardous
    to attack them, as they are sure to turn upon their pursuers, who
    have often to fly to each others assistance (<a href="#i_112"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 112</a>). The
    buffalo calf, during the first six months is red, and has so much the
    appearance of a red calf in cultivated fields, that it could easily be
    mingled and mistaken amongst them. In the fall, when it changes its
    hair it takes a brown coat for the winter, which it always retains.
    In pursuing a large herd of buffaloes at the season when their calves
    are but a few weeks old, I have often been exceedingly amused with the
    curious manœuvres of these shy little things. Amidst the thundering
    confusion of a throng of several hundreds or several thousands of
    these animals, there will be many of the calves that lose sight
    of their dams; and being left behind by the throng, and the swift
    passing hunters, they endeavour to secrete themselves, when they are
    exceedingly put to it on a level prairie, where nought can be seen but
    the short grass of six or eight inches in height, save an occasional
    bunch of wild sage, a few inches higher, to which the poor affrighted
    things will run, and dropping on their knees, will push their noses
    under it, and into the grass, where they will stand for hours, with
    their eyes shut, imagining themselves securely hid, whilst they are
    standing up quite straight upon their hind feet and can easily be seen
    at several miles distance. It is a familiar amusement for us accustomed
    to these scenes, to retreat back over the ground where we have just
    escorted the herd, and approach these little trembling things, which
    stubbornly maintain their positions, with their noses pushed under
    the grass, and their eyes strained upon us, as we dismount from our
    horses and are passing around them. From this fixed position they are
    sure not to move, until hands are laid upon them, and then for the
    shins of a novice, we can extend our sympathy; or if he can preserve
    the skin on his bones from the furious buttings of its head, we know
    how to congratulate him on his signal success and good luck. In these
    desperate struggles, for a moment, the little thing is conquered,
    and makes no further resistance. And I have often, in concurrence
    with a known custom of the country, held my hands over the eyes of
    the calf, and breathed a few strong breaths into its nostrils; after
    which I have, with my hunting companions, rode several miles into our
    encampment, with the little prisoner busily following the heels of my
    horse the whole way, as closely and as affectionately as its instinct
    would attach it to the company of its dam!</p>

  <p>This is one of the most extraordinary things that I have met with
    in the habits of this wild country, and although I had often heard
    of it, and felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span> unable exactly to believe it, I am now willing to
    bear testimony to the fact, from the numerous instances which I have
    witnessed since I came into the country. During the time that I resided
    at this post, in the spring of the year, on my way up the river, I
    assisted (in numerous hunts of the buffalo, with the Fur Company’s
    men,) in bringing in, in the above manner, several of these little
    prisoners, which sometimes followed for five or six miles close to
    our horses’ heels, and even into the Fur Company’s Fort, and into the
    stable where our horses were led. In this way, before I left for the
    head waters of the Missouri, I think we had collected about a dozen,
    which Mr. Laidlaw was successfully raising with the aid of a good milch
    cow, and which were to be committed to the care of Mr. Chouteau to be
    transported by the return of the steamer, to his extensive plantation
    in the vicinity of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

  <p>It is truly a melancholy contemplation for the traveller in this
    country, to anticipate the period which is not far distant, when the
    last of these noble animals, at the hands of white and red men, will
    fall victims to their cruel and improvident rapacity; leaving these
    beautiful green fields, a vast and idle waste, unstocked and unpeopled
    for ages to come, until the bones of the one and the traditions of the
    other will have vanished, and left scarce an intelligible trace behind.</p>

  <p>That the reader should not think me visionary in these contemplations,
    or romancing in making such assertions, I will hand him the following
    item of the extravagancies which are practiced in these regions, and
    rapidly leading to the results which I have just named.</p>

  <p>When I first arrived at this place, on my way up the river, which was
    in the month of May, in 1832, and had taken up my lodgings in the Fur
    Company’s Fort, Mr. Laidlaw, of whom I have before spoken, and also his
    chief clerk, Mr. Halsey, and many of their men, as well as the chiefs
    of the Sioux, told me, that only a few days before I arrived, (when an
    immense herd of buffaloes had showed themselves on the opposite side of
    the river, almost blackening the plains for a great distance,) a party
    of five or six hundred Sioux Indians on horseback, forded the river
    about mid-day, and spending a few hours amongst them, recrossed the
    river at sun-down and came into the Fort with <em>fourteen hundred fresh
    buffalo tongues</em>, which were thrown down in a mass, and for which
    they required but a few gallons of whiskey, which was soon demolished,
    indulging them in a little, and harmless carouse.</p>

  <p>This profligate waste of the lives of these noble and useful animals,
    when, from all that I could learn, not a skin or a pound of the
    meat (except the tongues), was brought in, fully supports me in
    the seemingly extravagant <span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>predictions that I have made as to
    their extinction, which I am certain is near at hand. In the above
    extravagant instance, at a season when their skins were without fur and
    not worth taking off, and their camp was so well stocked with fresh and
    dried meat, that they had no occasion for using the flesh, there is a
    fair exhibition of the improvident character of the savage, and also of
    his recklessness in catering for his appetite, so long as the present
    inducements are held out to him in his country, for its gratification.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>75</i></div>
  <figure id="i_111">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_111.jpg" alt="" />
     <figcaption>111</figcaption>

    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_112.jpg" alt="" />
     <figcaption>112</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>In this singular country, where the poor Indians have no laws or
    regulations of society, making it a vice or an impropriety to drink to
    excess, they think it no harm to indulge in the delicious beverage, as
    long as they are able to buy whiskey to drink. They look to white men
    as wiser than themselves, and able to set them examples—they see none
    of these in their country but sellers of whiskey, who are constantly
    tendering it to them, and most of them setting the example by using it
    themselves; and they easily acquire a taste, that to be catered for,
    where whiskey is sold at sixteen dollars per gallon, soon impoverishes
    them, and must soon strip the skin from the last buffalo’s back that
    lives in their country, to “be dressed by their squaws” and vended to
    the Traders for a pint of diluted alcohol.</p>

  <p>From the above remarks it will be seen, that not only the red men, but
    red men and white, have aimed destruction at the race of these animals;
    and with them, <em>beasts</em> have turned hunters of buffaloes in this
    country, slaying them, however, in less numbers, and for far more
    laudable purpose than that of selling their skins. The white wolves, of
    which I have spoken in a former epistle, follow the herds of buffaloes
    as I have said, from one season to another, glutting themselves on the
    carcasses of those that fall by the deadly shafts of their enemies,
    or linger with disease or old age to be dispatched by these sneaking
    cormorants, who are ready at all times kindly to relieve them from the
    pangs of a lingering death.</p>

  <p>Whilst the herd is together, the wolves never attack them, as they
    instantly gather for combined resistance, which they effectually make.
    But when the herds are travelling, it often happens that an aged or
    wounded one, lingers at a distance behind, and when fairly out of sight
    of the herd, is set upon by these voracious hunters, which often gather
    to the number of fifty or more, and are sure at last to torture him
    to death, and use him up at a meal. The buffalo, however, is a huge
    and furious animal, and when his retreat is cut off, makes desperate
    and deadly resistance, contending to the last moment for the right of
    life—and oftentimes deals death by wholesale, to his canine assailants,
    which he is tossing into the air or stamping to death under his feet
    (<a href="#i_113"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 113</a>).</p>

  <p>During my travels in these regions, I have several times come across
    such a gang of these animals surrounding an old or a wounded bull,
    where it would seem, from appearances, that they had been for several
    days in attendance, and at intervals desperately engaged in the
    effort to take his life. But a short time since, as one of my hunting
    companions and myself were returning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span> to our encampment with our horses
    loaded with meat, we discovered at a distance, a huge bull, encircled
    with a gang of white wolves; we rode up as near as we could without
    driving them away, and being within pistol shot, we had a remarkably
    good view, where I sat for a few moments and made a sketch in my
    note-book (<a href="#i_114"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 114</a>); after which, we rode up and gave the
    signal for them to disperse, which they instantly did, withdrawing
    themselves to the distance of fifty or sixty rods, when we found, to
    our great surprise, that the animal had made desperate resistance,
    until his eyes were entirely eaten out of his head—the grizzle of his
    nose was mostly gone—his tongue was half eaten off, and the skin and
    flesh of his legs torn almost literally into strings. In this tattered
    and torn condition, the poor old veteran stood bracing up in the midst
    of his devourers, who had ceased hostilities for a few minutes, to
    enjoy a sort of parley, recovering strength and preparing to resume
    the attack in a few moments again. In this group, some were reclining,
    to gain breath, whilst others were sneaking about and licking their
    chaps in anxiety for a renewal of the attack; and others, less lucky,
    had been crushed to death by the feet or the horns of the bull. I rode
    nearer to the pitiable object as he stood bleeding and trembling before
    me, and said to him, “Now is your time, old fellow, and you had better
    be off.” Though blind and nearly destroyed, there seemed evidently
    to be a recognition of a friend in me, as he straightened up, and,
    trembling with excitement, dashed off at full speed upon the prairie,
    in a straight line. We turned our horses and resumed our march, and
    when we had advanced a mile or more, we looked back, and on our left,
    where we saw again the ill-fated animal surrounded by his tormentors,
    to whose insatiable voracity he unquestionably soon fell a victim.</p>

  <p>Thus much I wrote of the buffaloes, and of the accidents that befall
    them, as well as of the fate that awaits them; and before I closed my
    book, I strolled out one day to the shade of a plum-tree, where I laid
    in the grass on a favourite bluff, and wrote thus:—</p>

  <p>“It is generally supposed, and familiarly said, that a man
    ‘<em>falls</em>’ into a rêverie; but I seated myself in the shade a few
    minutes since, resolved to <em>force</em> myself into one; and for this
    purpose I laid open a small pocket-map of North America, and excluding
    my thoughts from every other object in the world, I soon succeeded in
    producing the desired illusion. This little chart, over which I bent,
    was seen in all its parts, as nothing but the green and vivid reality.
    I was lifted up upon an imaginary pair of wings, which easily raised
    and held me floating in the open air, from whence I could behold
    beneath me the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans—the great cities of the
    East, and the mighty rivers. I could see the blue chain of the great
    lakes at the North—the Rocky Mountains, and beneath them and near
    their base, the vast, and almost boundless plains of grass, which were
    speckled with the bands of grazing buffaloes!</p>

  <p>“The world turned gently around, and I examined its surface; continent
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>after continent passed under my eye, and yet amidst them all, I saw
    not the vast and vivid green, that is spread like a carpet over the
    Western wilds of my own country. I saw not elsewhere in the world, the
    myriad herds of buffaloes—my eyes scanned in vain, for they were not.
    And when I turned again to the wilds of my native land, I beheld them
    all in motion! For the distance of several hundreds of miles from North
    to South, they were wheeling about in vast columns and herds—some were
    scattered, and ran with furious wildness—some lay dead, and others
    were pawing the earth for a hiding-place—some were sinking down and
    dying, gushing out their life’s blood in deep-drawn sighs—and others
    were contending in furious battle for the life they possessed, and
    the ground that they stood upon. They had long since assembled from
    the thickets, and secret haunts of the deep forest, into the midst of
    the treeless and bushless plains, as the place for their safety. I
    could see in an hundred places, amid the wheeling bands, and on their
    skirts and flanks, the leaping wild horse darting among them. I saw
    not the arrows, nor heard the twang of the sinewy bows that sent them;
    but I saw their victims fall!—on other steeds that rushed along their
    sides I saw the glistening lances, which seemed to lay across them;
    their blades were blazing in the sun, till dipped in blood, and then
    I lost them! In other parts (and there were many), the vivid flash of
    <em>fire-arms</em> was seen—<em>their</em> victims fell too, and over their
    dead bodies hung suspended in air, little clouds of whitened smoke,
    from under which the flying horsemen had darted forward to mingle again
    with, and deal death to, the trampling throng.</p>

  <p>“So strange were men mixed (both red and white) with the countless
    herds that wheeled and eddyed about, that all below seemed one vast
    extended field of battle—whole armies, in some places, seemed to
    blacken the earth’s surface;—in other parts, regiments, battalions,
    wings, platoons, rank and file, and “<em>Indian-file</em>”—all were in
    motion; and death and destruction seemed to be the watch-word amongst
    them. In their turmoil, they sent up great clouds of dust, and with
    them came the mingled din of groans and trampling hoofs, that seemed
    like the rumbling of a dreadful cataract, or the roaring of distant
    thunder. Alternate pity and admiration harrowed up in my bosom and my
    brain, many a hidden thought; and amongst them a few of the beautiful
    notes that were once sung, and exactly in point: ‘<i lang="la">Quadrupedante
    putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum.</i>’ Even such was the din amidst
    the quadrupeds of these vast plains. And from the craggy cliffs of the
    Rocky Mountains also were seen descending into the valley, the myriad
    Tartars, who had not horses to ride, but before their well-drawn bows
    the fattest of the herds were falling. Hundreds and thousands were
    strewed upon the plains—they were flayed, and their reddened carcasses
    left; and about them bands of wolves, and dogs, and buzzards were
    seen devouring them. Contiguous, and in sight, were the distant and
    feeble smokes of wigwams and villages, where the skins were dragged,
    and dressed for white man’s luxury! where they were all sold for
    <em>whiskey</em>, and the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span> Indians laid drunk, and were crying.
    I cast my eyes into the towns and cities of the East, and there I
    beheld buffalo robes hanging at almost every door for traffic; and I
    saw also the curling smokes of a thousand <em>Stills</em>—and I said,
    ‘Oh insatiable man, is thy avarice such! wouldst thou tear the skin
    from the back of the last animal of this noble race, <em>and rob thy
    fellow-man of his meat, and for it give him poison</em>!’” <span class="gesperrtstar">* * * * * * * * * * *</span></p>

  <p>Many are the rudenesses and wilds in Nature’s works, which are destined
    to fall before the deadly axe and desolating hands of cultivating man;
    and so amongst her ranks of <em>living</em>, of beast and human, we
    often find noble stamps, or beautiful colours, to which our admiration
    clings; and even in the overwhelming march of civilized improvements
    and refinements do we love to cherish their existence, and lend our
    efforts to preserve them in their primitive rudeness. Such of Nature’s
    works are always worthy of our preservation and protection; and the
    further we become separated (and the face of the country) from that
    pristine wildness and beauty, the more pleasure does the mind of
    enlightened man feel in recurring to those scenes, when he can have
    them preserved for his eyes and his mind to dwell upon.</p>

  <p>Of such “rudenesses and wilds,” Nature has no where presented more
    beautiful and lovely scenes, than those of the vast prairies of the
    West; and of <em>man</em> and <em>beast</em>, no nobler specimens than
    those who inhabit them—the <em>Indian</em> and the <em>buffalo</em>—joint
    and original tenants of the soil, and fugitives together from the
    approach of civilized man; they have fled to the great plains of the
    West, and there, under an equal doom, they have taken up their <em>last
    abode</em>, where their race will expire, and their bones will bleach
    together.</p>

  <p>It may be that <em>power</em> is <em>right</em>, and <em>voracity</em> a
    <em>virtue</em>; and that these people, and these noble animals, are
    <em>righteously</em> doomed to an issue that <em>will</em> not be averted.
    It can be easily proved—we have a civilized science that can easily do
    it, or anything else that may be required to cover the iniquities of
    civilized man in catering for his unholy appetites. It can be proved
    that the weak and ignorant have no <em>rights</em>—that there can be no
    virtue in darkness—that God’s gifts have no meaning or merit until they
    are appropriated by civilized man—by him brought into the light, and
    converted to his use and luxury. We have a mode of reasoning (I forget
    what it is called) by which all this can be proved, and even more. The
    <em>word</em> and the <em>system</em> are entirely of <em>civilized</em>
    origin; and latitude is admirably given to them in proportion to
    the increase of civilized wants, which often require a <em>judge</em>
    to overrule the laws of nature. I say that <em>we</em> can prove such
    things; but an <em>Indian</em> cannot. It is a mode of reasoning unknown
    to him in his nature’s simplicity, but admirably adapted to subserve
    the interests of the enlightened world, who are always their own
    judges, when dealing with the savage; and who, in the present refined
    age, have many appetites that can only be lawfully indulged, by proving
    God’s laws defective.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>

  <p>It is not enough in this polished and extravagant age, that we get from
    the Indian his lands, and the very clothes from his back, but the food
    from their mouths must be stopped, to add a new and useless article to
    the fashionable world’s luxuries. The ranks must be thinned, and the
    race exterminated, of this noble animal, and the Indians of the great
    plains left without the means of supporting life, that white men may
    figure a few years longer, enveloped in buffalo robes—that they may
    spread them, for their pleasure and elegance, over the backs of their
    sleighs, and trail them ostentatiously amidst the busy throng, as
    things of beauty and elegance that had been made for them!</p>

  <p>Reader! listen to the following calculations, and forget them not.
    The buffaloes (the quadrupeds from whose backs your beautiful robes
    were taken, and whose myriads were once spread over the whole country,
    from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean) have recently fled
    before the appalling appearance of civilized man, and taken up their
    abode and pasturage amid the almost boundless prairies of the West.
    An instinctive dread of their deadly foes, who made an easy prey of
    them whilst grazing in the forest, has led them to seek the midst of
    the vast and treeless plains of grass, as the spot where they would be
    least exposed to the assaults of their enemies; and it is exclusively
    in those desolate fields of silence (yet of beauty) that they are to
    be found—and over these vast steppes, or prairies, have they fled,
    like the Indian, towards the “setting sun;” until their bands have
    been crowded together, and their limits confined to a narrow strip of
    country on this side of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

  <p>This strip of country, which extends from the province of Mexico to
    lake Winnepeg on the North, is almost one entire plain of grass, which
    is, and ever must be, useless to cultivating man. It is here, and
    here chiefly, that the buffaloes dwell; and with, and hovering about
    them, live and flourish the tribes of Indians, whom God made for the
    enjoyment of that fair land and its luxuries.</p>

  <p>It is a melancholy contemplation for one who has travelled as I have,
    through these realms, and seen this noble animal in all its pride and
    glory, to contemplate it so rapidly wasting from the world, drawing the
    irresistible conclusion too, which one must do, that its species is
    soon to be extinguished, and with it the peace and happiness (if not
    the actual existence) of the tribes of Indians who are joint tenants
    with them, in the occupancy of these vast and idle plains.</p>

  <p>And what a splendid contemplation too, when one (who has travelled
    these realms, and can duly appreciate them) imagines them as they
    <em>might</em> in future be seen, (by some great protecting policy of
    government) preserved in their pristine beauty and wildness, in a
    <em>magnificent park</em>, where the world could see for ages to come,
    the native Indian in his classic attire, galloping his wild horse,
    with sinewy bow, and shield and lance, amid the fleeting herds of elks
    and buffaloes. What a beautiful and thrilling specimen for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span> America to
    preserve and hold up to the view of her refined citizens and the world,
    in future ages! A <em>nation’s Park</em>, containing man and beast, in
    all the wild and freshness of their nature’s beauty!</p>

  <p>I would ask no other monument to my memory, nor any other enrolment of
    my name amongst the famous dead, than the reputation of having been the
    founder of such an institution.</p>

  <p>Such scenes might easily have been preserved, and still could be
    cherished on the great plains of the West, without detriment to
    the country or its borders; for the tracts of country on which the
    buffaloes have assembled, are uniformly sterile, and of no available
    use to cultivating man.</p>

  <p>It is on these plains, which are stocked with buffaloes, that the
    finest specimens of the Indian race are to be seen. It is here, that
    the savage is decorated in the richest costume. It is here, and here
    only, that his wants are all satisfied, and even the <em>luxuries</em> of
    life are afforded him in abundance. And here also is he the proud and
    honourable man (before he has had teachers or laws), above the imported
    wants, which beget meanness and vice; stimulated by ideas of honour and
    virtue, in which the God of Nature has certainly not curtailed him.</p>

  <p>There are, by a fair calculation, more than 300,000 Indians, who are
    now subsisted on the flesh of the buffaloes, and by those animals
    supplied with all the luxuries of life which they desire, as they
    know of none others. The great variety of uses to which they convert
    the body and other parts of that animal, are almost incredible to
    the person who has not actually dwelt amongst these people, and
    closely studied their modes and customs. Every part of their flesh is
    converted into food, in one shape or another, and on it they entirely
    subsist. The robes of the animals are worn by the Indians instead of
    blankets—their skins when tanned, are used as coverings for their
    lodges, and for their beds; undressed, they are used for constructing
    canoes—for saddles, for bridles—l’arrêts, lasos, and thongs. The horns
    are shaped into ladles and spoons—the brains are used for dressing the
    skins—their bones are used for saddle trees—for war clubs, and scrapers
    for graining the robes—and others are broken up for the marrow-fat
    which is contained in them. Their sinews are used for strings and backs
    to their bows—for thread to string their beads and sew their dresses.
    The feet of the animals are boiled, with their hoofs, for the glue
    they contain, for fastening their arrow points, and many other uses.
    The hair from the head and shoulders, which is long, is twisted and
    braided into halters, and the tail is used for a fly brush. In this
    wise do these people convert and use the various parts of this useful
    animal, and with all these luxuries of life about them, and their
    numerous games, they are happy (God bless them) in the ignorance of the
    disastrous fate that awaits them.</p>

  <p>Yet this interesting community, with its sports, its wildnesses, its
    languages, and all its manners and customs, could be perpetuated, and
    also the buffaloes, whose numbers would increase and supply them with
    food for ages and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span> centuries to come, if a system of non-intercourse
    could be established and preserved. But such is not to be the case—the
    buffalo’s doom is sealed, and with their extinction must assuredly sink
    into real despair and starvation, the inhabitants of these vast plains,
    which afford for the Indians, no other possible means of subsistence;
    and they must at last fall a prey to wolves and buzzards, who will have
    no other bones to pick.</p>

  <p>It seems hard and cruel, (does it not?) that we civilized people with
    all the luxuries and comforts of the world about us, should be drawing
    from the backs of these useful animals the skins for our luxury,
    leaving their carcasses to be devoured by the wolves—that we should
    draw from that country, some 150 or 200,000 of their robes annually,
    the greater part of which are taken from animals that are killed
    expressly for the robe, at a season when the meat is not cured and
    preserved, and for each of which skins the Indian has received but a
    pint of whiskey!</p>

  <p>Such is the fact, and that number or near it, are annually destroyed,
    in addition to the number that is necessarily killed for the
    subsistence of 300,000 Indians, who live entirely upon them. It may
    be said, perhaps, that the Fur Trade of these great western realms,
    which is now limited chiefly to the purchase of buffalo robes, is of
    great and national importance, and should and must be encouraged. To
    such a suggestion I would reply, by merely enquiring, (independently
    of the poor Indians’ disasters,) how much more advantageously would
    such a capital be employed, both for the weal of the country and for
    the owners, if it were invested in machines for the manufacture of
    <em>woollen robes</em>, of equal and superior value and beauty; thereby
    encouraging the growers of wool, and the industrious manufacturer,
    rather than cultivating a taste for the use of buffalo skins; which is
    just to be acquired, and then, from necessity, to be dispensed with,
    when a few years shall have destroyed the last of the animals producing
    them.</p>

  <p>It may be answered, perhaps, that the necessaries of life are given in
    exchange for these robes; but what, I would ask, are the necessities
    in Indian life, where they have buffaloes in abundance to live on? The
    Indian’s necessities are entirely artificial—are all created; and when
    the buffaloes shall have disappeared in his country, which will be
    within <em>eight</em> or <em>ten</em> years, I would ask, who is to supply
    him with the necessaries of life then? and I would ask, further, (and
    leave the question to be answered ten years hence), when the skin shall
    have been stripped from the back of the last animal, who is to resist
    the ravages of 300,000 starving savages; and in their trains, 1,500,000
    wolves, whom direst necessity will have driven from their desolate and
    gameless plains, to seek for the means of subsistence along our exposed
    frontier? God has everywhere supplied man in a state of Nature, with
    the necessaries of life, and before we destroy the game of his country,
    or teach him new desires, he has no wants that are not satisfied.</p>

  <p>Amongst the tribes who have been impoverished and repeatedly removed,
    the necessaries of life are extended with a better grace from the
    hands of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span> civilized man; 90,000 of such have already been removed, and
    they draw from Government some 5 or 600,000 dollars annually in cash;
    <em>which money passes immediately into the hands of white men</em>, and
    for it the necessaries of life <em>may be</em> abundantly furnished. But
    who, I would ask, are to furnish the Indians who have been instructed
    in this unnatural mode—living upon <em>such</em> necessaries, and even
    luxuries of life, extended to them by the hands of white men, when
    those annuities are at an end, and the skin is stripped from the last
    of the animals which God gave them for their subsistence?</p>

  <p>Reader, I will stop here, lest you might forget to answer these
    important queries—these are questions which I know will puzzle the
    world—and, perhaps it is not right that I should ask them. <span class="gesperrtstar">* * * * * * * * *</span></p>

  <p><span class="gesperrtstar">* *</span> Thus much I wrote and painted at this place, whilst on my way up
    the river: after which I embarked on the steamer for the Yellow Stone,
    and the sources of the Missouri, through which interesting regions I
    have made a successful Tour; and have returned, as will have been seen
    by the foregoing narrations, in my canoe, to this place, from whence
    I am to descend the river still further in a few days. If I ever get
    time, I may give further Notes on this place, and of people and their
    doings, which I met with here; but at present, I throw my note-book,
    and canvass, and brushes into my canoe, which will be launched
    to-morrow morning, and on its way towards <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, with myself at
    the steering-oar, as usual; and with Ba’tiste and Bogard to paddle, of
    whom, I beg the readers’ pardon for having said nothing of late, though
    they have been my constant companions. Our way is now over the foaming
    and muddy waters of the Missouri, and amid snags and drift logs (for
    there is a sweeping freshet on her waters), and many a day will pass
    before other Letters will come from me; and possibly, the reader may
    have to look to my biographer for the rest. Adieu.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
